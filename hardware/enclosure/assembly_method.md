# Enclosure Assembly Method

This document describes the step-by-step assembly process for the Seed device enclosure. The enclosure is designed for durability, low-cost manufacturing, ease of field maintenance, and compatibility with off-grid environments. The assembly method aligns with mass-production workflows while remaining feasible for small-batch prototyping.

## 1. Assembly Objectives

- Protect internal electronics from dust, water, heat, and impact.
- Maintain structural rigidity under daily usage and field conditions.
- Enable rapid assembly in low-infrastructure manufacturing environments.
- Support disassembly for repair, battery replacement, and diagnostics.
- Ensure proper alignment of the display, buttons, antenna, and charging mechanisms.
- Minimize part count to reduce costs and simplify supply chains.

## 2. Required Components

- Front enclosure shell
- Rear enclosure shell
- Internal mounting frame (PCB carrier)
- PCB assembly (main board + radio module)
- E-ink display module
- Button actuator module (mechanical or capacitive)
- Rechargeable battery pack
- Antenna module (internal or external)
- Gaskets and environmental seals
- Heat spreader or thermal pads (if required)
- Fasteners (screws or snap-fit points)
- Optional tamper-evident labels

---

## 3. Required Tools

- Precision screwdriver set or torque drivers
- Anti-static work mat and wrist strap
- Alignment jig (for consistent display placement)
- Small plastic pry tool (for non-destructive disassembly)
- Adhesive applicator (if adhesives are used)
- Multimeter for quick continuity checks (optional)

## 4. Pre-Assembly Preparation

### PCB Preparation
- Flash firmware and confirm boot functionality.
- Run basic radio and button tests.
- Attach secure element and fingerprint module (if applicable).
- Solder battery or verify connector polarity.

### Enclosure Preparation
- Inspect parts for warping, cracks, or molding defects.
- Verify gasket placement.
- Pre-install brass inserts if the design uses screw-in fastening.
- Clean interior surfaces to avoid dust accumulation on the e-ink display.

## 5. Step-by-Step Assembly Procedure

### Step 1: Install the E-Ink Display
- Place the display into the front enclosure shell.
- Align using positioning tabs.
- Secure with clips or light adhesive depending on the design.
- Route the display ribbon through the designated channel to the PCB area.

### Step 2: Mount the PCB
- Place the PCB onto the internal frame or standoff pillars.
- Ensure antenna clearance is maintained.
- Insert screws at specified torque or engage snap-fit mounts.
- Connect the display ribbon cable to the PCB.

### Step 3: Install the Battery
- Insert the battery into its compartment.
- Apply foam padding to reduce vibration and stress.
- Connect the battery cable to the PCB.
- Verify that it does not obstruct button actuation or radio components.

### Step 4: Add Buttons and External Interfaces
- Insert mechanical buttons or capacitive overlays.
- Test button travel and alignment.
- Install charging port cover or protective membrane.

### Step 5: Seal the Enclosure
- Place the environmental gasket around the perimeter.
- Align the rear shell with the front.
- Press gently to seat the components.
- Fasten screws or engage snap-fit locking points.

### Step 6: Final Assembly Check
- Power on the device.
- Verify display output.
- Test radio communication.
- Test all buttons.
- Perform battery charge/discharge sanity check.
- Apply tamper-evident labels if required.

## 6. Quality Assurance Guidelines

- Check that all seams are uniformly sealed.
- Shake-test device lightly for loose components.
- Ensure no ribbon cables are pinched.
- Validate display is dust-free and properly centered.
- Confirm device meets drop, heat, and environmental standards.

---

## 7. Field Repair Considerations

- Use standard fasteners to allow repair technicians easy access.
- Avoid adhesives except where mechanically necessary.
- Modular components (battery, display, buttons) should be replaceable.
- Provide torque specifications so screws are not overtightened.
- Internal layout should minimize risk of cable damage during disassembly.

---

## 8. Mass Production Recommendations

- Create assembly line stations for display, battery, PCB, and final QC.
- Implement automated screwdrivers for consistent fastening torque.
- Use injection-molded plastic with integrated snap-fits for faster assembly.
- Maintain global suppliers for enclosure materials to reduce risk.
- Perform random sampling durability tests per production batch.

## 9. Summary

The Seed enclosure assembly method prioritizes durability, repairability, environmental resistance, and manufacturability. By reducing part count, using modular components, and enforcing strict alignment and QC procedures, the device can be produced reliably at scale while remaining serviceable in low-resource regions. The mechanical design ensures the enclosure protects the internal mesh-networking, secure storage, and financial tools that Seed provides to underserved communities.
