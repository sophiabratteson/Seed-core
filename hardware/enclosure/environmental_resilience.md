# Environmental Resilience

This document outlines the environmental durability requirements and design strategies for the Seed enclosure. Because Seed is intended for extreme low-infrastructure environments—including heat, dust, humidity, rain, and physical wear—its enclosure must provide long-term resilience without compromising usability or cost.

## 1. Environmental Design Goals

- Maintain device function across wide temperature ranges.
- Protect internal electronics from dust, moisture, and accidental submersion.
- Withstand repeated drops, abrasion, and field transport.
- Resist UV degradation in sunlight-heavy regions.
- Operate reliably in rural, disaster-relief, and low-resource settings.
- Preserve screen readability in harsh lighting conditions.
- Prevent battery swelling, overheating, or environmental failure.

## 2. Target Operating Conditions

### Temperature
- Operating range: **–10°C to +55°C**
- Storage range: **–20°C to +60°C**
- Design considerations:
  - Use **LiFePO₄** battery chemistry to reduce thermal risk.
  - Avoid adhesives that soften above 50°C.
  - E-ink display selected for outdoor thermal stability.

### Humidity
- Relative humidity tolerance: **10% – 95% non-condensing**
- Exposure scenarios:
  - Tropical climates
  - Monsoon seasons
  - Indoor/outdoor transitions
- Mitigation:
  - Internal gasket seals
  - Conformal coating of PCB
  - Hydrophobic vent membranes for pressure equalization

### Dust & Dirt
- Minimum ingress protection goal: **IP54**
- Long-term goal: **IP57** without increasing manufacturing cost.
- Protection methods:
  - Tight injection-molded seam design
  - Dust baffles around buttons
  - No exposed electrical pads

### Water Exposure
- Splash-proof and rain-proof by default.
- Not designed for fully underwater use.
- Tested against:
  - Dripping water
  - Light hoses
  - Weather exposure during charging or operation

## 3. Structural Durability Requirements

### Drop Resistance
- Survive **1.0–1.5 m** drops onto hard surfaces (e.g., concrete).
- At least **10 consecutive drops** during durability testing.
- Protective strategies:
  - Internal shock-absorbing frame
  - Slightly raised bezel around e-ink display
  - TPU corner reinforcement

### Scratch & Abrasion Resistance
- Plastic shell must withstand rubbing against:
  - Clothing
  - Backpacks
  - Dirt and sand
  - Rough surfaces
- Recommended materials:
  - PC-ABS blend
  - Optional rubberized TPU outer shell

### UV Resistance
- Devices may spend hours in sunlight.
- Materials must resist yellowing and brittleness.
- Coatings:
  - UV-stable matte finish
  - Anti-glare texture for e-ink visibility

### Chemical Resistance
- Must withstand light exposure to:
  - Sweat
  - Oils
  - Hand sanitizers
  - Mild cleaning agents
- Use non-reactive plastics and sealed seams.

## 4. Weather-Resilient Design Features

### Sealing Strategy
- Silicone perimeter gasket around enclosure seam.
- Snap-fit design with limited screw penetration to reduce leak points.
- Rubber membranes over buttons to prevent ingress.

### Pressure Equalization
- Use of **GORE-type vent** to:
  - Equalize internal pressure
  - Prevent condensation
  - Maintain water resistance

### Battery & Power Considerations
- LiFePO₄ battery selected for:
  - Low fire risk
  - High heat tolerance
  - Long cycle life
- Battery protected with:
  - Thermal pad
  - Insulating barrier between PCB and enclosure wall

### Antenna Performance in Harsh Environments
- Antenna placed away from interference and metallic surfaces.
- Temperature-stable antenna substrate.
- Weather-proof antenna opening or internal antenna hidden under shell.

## 5. Field Maintenance & Longevity

### Cleaning & Care
- Device should withstand:
  - Wiping with cloth
  - Rinsing under light water (not submersion)
  - Exposure to dust storms followed by cleaning

### Replaceable Parts
- Battery should be semi-accessible for field technicians.
- Screws should be standardized across all devices.
- Display replacement planned for long-term repairs.

### Expected Lifespan
- **3–5 years** in moderate environments.
- **2–3 years** in extreme high-temperature or high-moisture regions.
- Internal component derating to maximize survival margins.

## 6. Environmental Testing Plan

### Required Tests
- High-temperature bake test
- Low-temperature freeze test
- 95% humidity chamber test
- Drop test (multiple angles)
- Dust chamber test (fine particulate)
- UV exposure test (accelerated cycle)
- Water spray test (simulated rainfall)

### Optional Extended Tests
- Solar aging simulation
- Salt fog test for coastal regions
- Vibration and shock transport test

## 7. Summary

Seed’s enclosure must be rugged, weatherproof, and reliable in regions where infrastructure is limited and environments are harsh. Incorporating robust materials, sealing strategies, and thermal protections ensures that the device remains functional in heat, humidity, dust, and rain, while drop-resistant design and replaceable components support long-term sustainability.

Environmental resilience is not optional for Seed—it is a fundamental requirement for delivering financial access to the people who need it most.
