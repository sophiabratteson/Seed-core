# Enclosure Ergonomics

This document defines the ergonomic design principles for the Seed device enclosure. Ergonomics is critical for ensuring that users in low-connectivity, harsh-environment regions can comfortably, safely, and reliably operate the device with minimal learning curve. The guiding principles prioritize accessibility, durability, and intuitive interaction.

---

# 1. Ergonomic Design Goals

- Ensure that the device is comfortable to hold and operate for a wide range of hand sizes.
- Minimize fatigue during repeated use (e.g., scanning fingerprints, navigating menus).
- Support one-handed and two-handed operation equally well.
- Reduce accidental button presses or unintended interactions.
- Provide clear tactile and visual cues for all input areas.
- Optimize grip and texture for humid, dusty, or extreme-weather conditions.
- Maintain usability in low-light or no-light environments.

---

# 2. Form Factor and Hand Fit

- Use a rounded-edge rectangular shape for natural hand conformity.
- Aim for a size similar to a compact feature phone:
  - Height: 90–110 mm
  - Width: 55–65 mm
  - Thickness: 12–18 mm
- Maintain a balanced weight distribution to avoid front- or back-heaviness.
- Include gentle curves on the back for palm support.
- Allow the device to be usable while wearing gloves, which is important for outdoor labor environments.

# 3. Grip and Surface Texture

- Use a dual-texture design:
  - Slightly rubberized sides for secure grip.
  - Smooth front surface for display clarity and input accuracy.
- Add micro-texturing on the rear panel to prevent slipping in humid or wet conditions.
- Avoid glossy materials that show dust, wear, and fingerprints easily.
- Provide optional lanyard or wrist-strap mounting points for users in mobile or high-risk settings.

---

# 4. Button Placement and Tactile Feedback

- Place the primary navigation buttons (up, down, select, back) centrally below the display for easy one-handed access.
- Ensure buttons provide:
  - 0.4–0.7 mm travel distance.
  - Clear tactile click feedback.
  - Distinct shapes or spacing to avoid accidental presses.
- Use raised or concave profiles to guide finger placement.
- Consider color contrast between buttons and casing for visually impaired users.

# 5. Fingerprint Sensor Ergonomics

- Position the fingerprint sensor on the front face, below the display, enabling:
  - Quick unlock.
  - Natural thumb placement when holding the device.
- Surround the sensor with a small recessed ring to guide finger alignment.
- Ensure adequate spacing from navigation buttons to avoid false presses.
- Optimize sensitivity for dry, dusty, or calloused skin — common conditions in manual labor environments.

---

# 6. Display Visibility and Readability

- Use a 2.13” E-Ink display to maximize readability in sunlight and low power usage.
- Include a matte display surface to reduce glare.
- Ensure font sizes, contrast, and spacing remain accessible to users with limited literacy or visual impairment.
- Avoid overly complex UI layouts — prioritize clarity and text-first interfaces.

---

# 7. Port, Antenna, and Charging Ergonomics

- Place charging ports (USB-C or magnetic dock) at the bottom or back to avoid strain during hand-held operation.
- Recess ports lightly to prevent debris accumulation.
- Ensure antenna placement minimizes RF obstruction by hands during operation.
- Use dust-resistant port covers where possible, especially in sandy or humid regions.

---

# 8. Environmental Ergonomics (Context-Aware Design)

- Design for usability under:
  - Direct sunlight.
  - Rain or humidity.
  - Dusty environments (agriculture, construction, rural markets).
- Ensure device remains operable with wet or dirty hands.
- Include physical cues (shape, texture, raised edges) for operation in darkness.

---

# 9. Accessibility Considerations

- Provide large, well-spaced navigation buttons for users with limited dexterity.
- Use high-contrast UI layouts for low-vision accessibility.
- Ensure consistent haptic feedback patterns.
- Design the device to function entirely without need for literacy:
  - Icon-based navigation.
  - Optional voice prompts or spoken confirmations.

---

# 10. Ergonomics Validation and Testing Plans

- Conduct field tests with:
  - Street vendors.
  - Farmers.
  - Refugee-camp residents.
  - Elderly users.
  - Youth with early technology exposure.
- Measure:
  - Grip comfort over long usage sessions.
  - Button press accuracy and fatigue.
  - Fingerprint scanner reliability across skin types.
  - Drop-test performance and hand recovery behavior.
- Incorporate iterative redesign based on real-world ergonomic stress tests.

# 11. Summary

Seed’s enclosure ergonomics are engineered for reliability, comfort, and accessibility in environments where traditional digital financial tools fail. The device must feel intuitive immediately, support offline-first operations, and give users confidence that their financial identity is secure and always accessible.

Ergonomic considerations ensure Seed is not just functional — it is practical, empowering, and usable by anyone, anywhere.
