# Enclosure Materials

This document outlines the recommended materials for the Seed device enclosure. The enclosure must withstand harsh environments, remain affordable, and support large-scale manufacturing in low-resource regions. Materials are selected based on durability, cost, manufacturability, environmental resilience, and compatibility with embedded electronics.

## 1. Material Requirements

The Seed enclosure must meet the following criteria:

- Low cost and suitable for mass production  
- Durable under heat, humidity, dust, and physical stress  
- Non-conductive and safe to handle  
- Resistant to UV exposure and long-term wear  
- Compatible with injection molding or 3D printing  
- Able to protect internal components from drops, vibration, and impact  
- Lightweight and comfortable for everyday carry  
- Recyclable or environmentally responsible where possible

## 2. Recommended Enclosure Materials

### Option A: Polycarbonate (PC)
Polycarbonate is a widely used engineering plastic with excellent strength and durability.

- High impact resistance  
- Good heat tolerance  
- Compatible with injection molding and prototyping  
- Surface holds up well to scratches  
- Slightly more expensive than ABS  

**Ideal use:** premium production units, long-term durability in hot climates.

---

### Option B: ABS Plastic
ABS is one of the most commonly used plastics for consumer electronics.

- Low-cost and easy to manufacture  
- Good balance of strength and flexibility  
- Ideal for rapid prototyping and early production  
- Performs well in moderate temperatures  

**Ideal use:** MVP production runs and prototypes.

---

### Option C: PC/ABS Blend
A hybrid of the above two materials.

- Impact strength of PC with affordability of ABS  
- Excellent dimensional stability for accurate part fits  
- Common choice for rugged electronics housings  

**Ideal use:** mass production where performance and cost must balance.

---

### Option D: Nylon (PA12 / PA11)
Typically used for 3D-printed prototypes.

- High tensile strength  
- Excellent abrasion resistance  
- Flexible enough to avoid cracking under stress  
- Performs well in humid environments  

**Ideal use:** 3D-printed prototypes, field prototypes for early testing.

---

### Option E: TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
Soft, rubber-like material.

- Flexible and impact absorbing  
- Shock resistant  
- Good for outer bumpers, not full enclosures  

**Ideal use:** protective outer layer or corner bumpers.

## 3. Recommended Bill of Materials for Enclosure

- Primary shell: PC/ABS blend  
- Internal frame/bracket: reinforced PC  
- Button caps: ABS or TPU  
- Gasket or weather sealing: silicone rubber  
- Screws: stainless steel M1.4 or M1.6  
- Display cover: hardened acrylic or Gorilla-Glass equivalent  

This combination creates a rugged, low-cost, field-ready device.

---

## 4. Environmental Performance Targets

The enclosure should meet the following conditions:

- Operating temperature: -10°C to +55°C  
- Storage temperature: -20°C to +70°C  
- Water resistance: splash-proof (IP54 target for MVP, higher later)  
- Dust resistance: moderate sealing at button openings  
- Drop resistance: survive 1.5m drop onto hard surface  
- UV stability: withstand long-term outdoor exposure  

---

## 5. Manufacturing Considerations

- Injection molding is recommended for mass production.  
- Wall thickness should be 1.5–2.5 mm for rigidity and flow uniformity.  
- Ribs and support structures should be added to prevent flexing.  
- Internal mounts for PCB, battery, and display must be integrated into the mold.  
- Draft angles of 1–2 degrees are required for mold release.  
- Texturing can be added to exterior surfaces for grip and durability.  

---

## 6. Cost Considerations

Approximate costs per enclosure (material only):

- ABS: $0.40–$0.70  
- PC/ABS blend: $0.60–$1.00  
- Pure PC: $0.80–$1.20  
- Nylon (3D print): $4–$10 (prototype only)  
- TPU bumpers: $0.10–$0.30  

Injection molding tooling adds upfront costs ($2k–$15k depending on complexity), but unit cost decreases dramatically at scale.

---

## 7. Sustainability Notes

- PC/ABS blend is recyclable.  
- ABS is recyclable in most regions.  
- Avoid exotic plastics that complicate waste management.  
- Consider implementing an enclosure take-back or recycling program.  

---

## 8. Summary

The Seed enclosure must be rugged, lightweight, low cost, and manufacturable in both small prototype batches and large production numbers. PC/ABS blend offers the best balance of durability and affordability for mass production, while ABS and Nylon provide excellent prototyping options. Environmental resistance, manufacturability, and user comfort drive the material selection.
