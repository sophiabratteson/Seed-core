# Logistics Overview

This document defines Seed’s logistics strategy for transporting, storing, distributing, and tracking Seed devices across low-connectivity, infrastructure-limited environments. The logistics system is designed to be resilient, low-cost, auditable, and scalable without relying on centralized digital systems.

---

## 1. Objectives of the Logistics System

The logistics framework for Seed is designed to:

- Enable reliable delivery of devices to remote, rural, and underserved regions
- Operate in environments with limited internet, power, and formal infrastructure
- Minimize cost while maintaining device integrity and security
- Support transparent tracking without requiring continuous connectivity
- Scale from small pilot deployments to national and cross-border rollouts

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

Seed logistics follow these core principles:

- **Offline-first operations**: All logistics processes must function without persistent internet access
- **Decentralized coordination**: No single point of failure or dependency on a central warehouse
- **Human-operable systems**: Processes must be executable by local partners with minimal training
- **Tamper awareness**: Device handling must detect or discourage unauthorized interference
- **Incremental scalability**: Logistics complexity increases only as deployment scale grows

---

## 3. Logistics Phases

Seed logistics are divided into five phases:

1. Pre-deployment staging
2. Regional transport
3. Local distribution
4. Field handoff and activation
5. Post-deployment support and recovery

Each phase is designed to operate independently if others are delayed or disrupted.

---

## 4. Pre-Deployment Staging

### 4.1 Device Preparation

Before shipment, each Seed device is:

- Assembled and tested at manufacturing or prototyping facilities
- Assigned a unique hardware identifier
- Loaded with initial firmware and configuration
- Placed in a locked or sealed transport state
- Logged into a shipment manifest (digital and/or physical)

### 4.2 Packaging Requirements

Packaging must:

- Protect against dust, moisture, and impact
- Be lightweight and stackable
- Include tamper-evident seals
- Allow labeling without revealing sensitive device purpose

---

## 5. Regional Transport Strategy

### 5.1 Transport Methods

Depending on region, Seed devices may be transported via:

- Ground vehicles (trucks, motorcycles)
- Public transit networks
- NGO or humanitarian supply chains
- Local courier services
- Cross-border freight where applicable

No single transport method is assumed or required.

### 5.2 Connectivity-Agnostic Tracking

Shipment tracking may use:

- Paper manifests with device batch IDs
- Periodic sync via Seed-enabled devices when connectivity is available
- Manual checkpoint confirmation by trusted partners

Real-time GPS or internet tracking is not required.

---

## 6. Local Distribution Model

### 6.1 Distribution Partners

Local distribution is handled by:

- Community organizations
- NGOs
- Microfinance institutions
- Cooperatives
- Local merchants or agents

Partners receive training and clear handoff procedures.

### 6.2 Distribution Units

Devices may be distributed:

- Individually to users
- In small batches to group leaders
- Through community events or enrollment days

Distribution processes are designed to be auditable without requiring digital systems.

---

## 7. Field Handoff and Activation

### 7.1 Device Handoff Process

At handoff, the following steps occur:

- Device serial number is confirmed
- Recipient identity is verified using local standards
- Device is unlocked or activated
- Initial trust score and configuration are set
- User receives basic training

### 7.2 Offline Activation

Activation does not require:

- Internet access
- Central server approval
- Banking infrastructure

Devices become active through local validation and cryptographic identity initialization.

---

## 8. Inventory and Stock Management

### 8.1 Inventory Tracking

Inventory may be tracked using:

- Batch-level accounting
- Ledger-based records synced opportunistically
- Physical logs maintained by partners

Inventory systems are designed to tolerate partial data and delayed reconciliation.

### 8.2 Loss and Shrinkage Handling

Procedures exist for:

- Lost shipments
- Damaged devices
- Stolen inventory
- Discrepancies between expected and actual counts

Each incident is logged and resolved without halting operations.

---

## 9. Returns, Repairs, and Redistribution

### 9.1 Device Returns

Devices may be returned due to:

- Hardware failure
- User upgrade
- Program exit
- Reallocation needs

Returned devices are wiped, inspected, and re-certified before reuse.

### 9.2 Field Repairs

Where possible:

- Repairs are handled locally
- Modular components are replaced
- Firmware issues are resolved via offline updates

Complex repairs are routed back through regional hubs.

---

## 10. Cross-Border Logistics Considerations

For international deployments:

- Customs documentation is minimized and standardized
- Devices are classified appropriately for import/export
- Regulatory requirements are reviewed per region
- Local assembly may be used to reduce border friction

Seed avoids dependency on fragile international shipping paths where possible.

---

## 11. Risk Management

Logistics risks include:

- Transport delays
- Political instability
- Infrastructure breakdowns
- Partner reliability issues
- Theft or diversion

Mitigation strategies include redundancy, decentralization, and local autonomy.

---

## 12. Scaling Strategy

As Seed scales:

- Logistics hubs become regional rather than centralized
- Partner networks expand horizontally
- Automation increases only where infrastructure allows
- Systems remain backward-compatible with low-tech workflows

Scaling does not compromise accessibility.

---

## 13. Metrics and Evaluation

Key logistics metrics include:

- Device delivery success rate
- Time from shipment to activation
- Loss and damage rates
- Partner fulfillment reliability
- Cost per device delivered

Metrics are collected opportunistically and reviewed periodically.

---

## 14. Summary

Seed’s logistics system is intentionally designed to function where traditional supply chains fail. By prioritizing offline-first operations, decentralized control, and human-operable workflows, Seed can deploy and scale globally without requiring fragile digital infrastructure.

This logistics framework enables Seed to reach the populations that need it most — reliably, securely, and sustainably.
