# Distribution Strategy

This document defines how Seed devices are distributed from manufacturing to end users in low-connectivity, high-need environments. The distribution strategy prioritizes accessibility, trust, cost efficiency, and resilience in regions where traditional financial and logistics infrastructure may be weak or absent.

---

## 1. Distribution Goals

- Reach underbanked and unbanked populations reliably
- Minimize reliance on centralized or fragile logistics systems
- Leverage trusted local organizations and networks
- Support both pilot-scale and large-scale rollouts
- Ensure devices arrive securely, activated, and usable

---

## 2. Target Distribution Channels

Seed devices are distributed through a hybrid, multi-channel approach.

### 2.1 NGO and Humanitarian Partners
- International NGOs
- Local non-profits
- Development agencies
- Disaster relief organizations

These partners:
- Already operate in target regions
- Have community trust
- Can manage training and onboarding
- Can distribute devices in bulk

### 2.2 Local Microfinance & Community Groups
- Savings groups
- Cooperatives
- Village associations
- Women-led financial collectives

Benefits:
- Peer accountability
- Natural alignment with group savings features
- Faster adoption through social trust

### 2.3 Government & Public Programs (Optional)
- Social benefit distribution
- Emergency aid disbursement
- Rural economic development programs

Used selectively due to regulatory complexity.

### 2.4 Direct Pilot Distribution
- Small pilot deployments
- Research trials
- Academic partnerships
- Field tests

Used during early MVP and validation stages.

---

## 3. Distribution Phases

### Phase 1: Pilot & Field Trials
- Small batches (50–500 devices)
- Distributed via trusted partners
- Close monitoring and feedback loops
- Manual provisioning and tracking

### Phase 2: Regional Rollouts
- Medium batches (1,000–10,000 devices)
- Standardized onboarding materials
- Local distribution hubs
- Semi-automated provisioning

### Phase 3: Scaled Deployment
- Large-scale distribution (10,000+ devices)
- Regional warehouses
- Local assembly or final configuration
- Automated provisioning and lifecycle tracking

## 4. Device Provisioning at Distribution

Each device is provisioned before or during distribution:

- Unique device identity generated
- Cryptographic keys created securely on-device
- Region-specific radio configuration applied
- Initial firmware verified
- Device registered in deployment records (not a central ledger)

Provisioning can occur:
- At factory
- At regional hubs
- On-site during distribution events

---

## 5. Training and Onboarding

Distribution includes user education:

- In-person training sessions
- Visual and audio guides
- Local language support
- Group-based onboarding models

Training covers:
- Basic device usage
- Sending and receiving value
- Group savings participation
- Security practices

---

## 6. Logistics Constraints and Adaptations

Seed distribution accounts for:
- Poor road infrastructure
- Intermittent customs access
- Limited power availability
- Security risks

Mitigations:
- Compact, rugged packaging
- Battery-safe shipping methods
- Regionally compliant radio configurations
- Local partner-led last-mile delivery

---

## 7. Inventory Tracking

Inventory tracking is:
- Decentralized
- Partner-managed
- Auditable

Tracking includes:
- Batch IDs
- Distribution region
- Partner organization
- Deployment date

Seed avoids real-time centralized tracking in early stages to preserve privacy and resilience.

---

## 8. Returns, Replacement, and Redistribution

Policies include:
- Device replacement for hardware failure
- Re-provisioning of returned devices
- Secure wipe before redistribution
- Local repair where feasible

Replacement decisions are handled by local partners using predefined guidelines.

---

## 9. Regulatory and Customs Considerations

Distribution plans account for:
- Radio frequency regulations
- Battery transport rules
- Import/export restrictions
- Humanitarian exemptions where applicable

Legal and compliance coordination occurs before entering new regions.

---

## 10. Success Metrics

Distribution effectiveness is measured by:
- Devices successfully activated
- User onboarding completion
- Retention after 30/90 days
- Group formation rates
- Transaction activity

These metrics inform future rollout decisions.

---

## 11. Summary

Seed’s distribution strategy is designed for environments where traditional logistics and finance fail. By leveraging trusted local partners, phased rollouts, and resilient provisioning models, Seed can reach the people who need it most while remaining scalable, secure, and adaptable.
