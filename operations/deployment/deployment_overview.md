# Deployment Overview

This document defines how Seed devices are deployed into real-world environments, from initial pilot rollouts to scaled regional deployments. The deployment strategy is designed for low-connectivity, low-infrastructure settings while maintaining security, reliability, and operational clarity.

---

## 1. Deployment Goals

The deployment process aims to:

- Enable rapid rollout of Seed devices in underserved regions
- Minimize dependency on centralized infrastructure
- Support offline-first operation from day one
- Ensure devices are secure, trusted, and functional upon delivery
- Allow gradual scaling from pilot programs to national or multi-country networks

---

## 2. Deployment Environments

Seed deployments are expected in a wide range of environments, including:

- Rural communities with limited or no internet access
- Refugee camps and temporary settlements
- Disaster recovery zones
- Informal markets and street vendor economies
- Remote villages without nearby banking infrastructure
- Low-income urban areas with unreliable connectivity

Each environment may require adjustments in training, logistics, and power provisioning, but the core deployment model remains consistent.

## 3. Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Pilot Deployment

- Small batch of devices (10–100 units)
- Focused on a single community or use case
- Goals:
  - Validate usability
  - Observe real-world mesh behavior
  - Identify operational bottlenecks
- Devices are often monitored closely by Seed team members or partners

### Phase 2: Regional Rollout

- Hundreds to thousands of devices
- Multiple communities or market clusters
- Goals:
  - Test scalability of mesh networking
  - Validate trust score and group savings mechanisms
  - Assess maintenance and support workflows

### Phase 3: Scaled Deployment

- Thousands to tens of thousands of devices
- Multi-region or multi-country
- Goals:
  - Establish self-sustaining device ecosystems
  - Reduce direct Seed team involvement
  - Enable local operators and partners to manage deployments

## 4. Device Provisioning Before Deployment

Before a device is deployed, it undergoes provisioning:

- Firmware installation and verification
- Secure element initialization
- Device identity generation (cryptographic keys)
- Regional configuration (radio frequency, power limits)
- Language and accessibility settings
- Initial trust score baseline

Provisioning may occur at:
- Seed-controlled facilities
- Partner manufacturing sites
- Regional distribution hubs

---

## 5. Distribution Models

Seed devices may be distributed through:

- Local NGOs and community organizations
- Microfinance institutions
- Cooperatives or savings groups
- Disaster relief agencies
- Government or municipal programs
- Direct-to-user pilot programs

Distribution partners are trained on:
- Device basics
- Security handling
- User onboarding procedures
- Replacement and escalation protocols

---

## 6. User Onboarding Process

When a user receives a Seed device:

1. Device is physically handed over
2. User is guided through initial setup:
   - Identity creation
   - Fingerprint enrollment
   - Language selection
3. User completes a short training flow:
   - How to send and receive value
   - How group savings works
   - How to keep the device secure
4. Device joins the local mesh network automatically

No internet or smartphone is required for onboarding.

---

## 7. Mesh Network Formation During Deployment

- Devices automatically discover nearby Seed devices
- Initial mesh formation occurs organically as users interact
- No centralized coordinator is required
- Mesh density improves as adoption increases
- Occasional gateway devices (with internet access) may sync global state but are optional

---

## 8. Power and Charging Considerations

Deployment planning includes:

- Assessing availability of sunlight for solar charging
- Providing hand-crank training where needed
- Educating users on battery care
- Supplying shared charging stations in dense deployments

Power independence is critical for successful deployment.

---

## 9. Maintenance and Support During Deployment

During early deployments:

- Devices are periodically inspected
- Logs and metrics are collected manually or opportunistically
- Faulty devices are swapped rather than repaired on-site
- Firmware updates are applied via mesh propagation when possible

As deployments mature:

- Local technicians are trained
- Community-led maintenance becomes standard
- Replacement pools are established regionally

---

## 10. Failure and Recovery Scenarios

Deployment plans account for:

- Device loss or theft
- Battery degradation
- Radio interference
- Partial mesh fragmentation
- User error or misuse

Seed devices are designed to fail safely:
- Funds remain secure
- Ledger integrity is preserved
- Lost devices can be remotely or locally invalidated

---

## 11. Deployment Metrics and Evaluation

Key metrics tracked during deployment include:

- Active devices per region
- Mesh connectivity density
- Transaction success rates
- Group savings participation
- Trust score evolution
- Device uptime and power reliability

These metrics inform future deployment decisions and investor reporting.

---

## 12. Transition to Long-Term Operations

Once deployment stabilizes:

- Responsibility shifts from deployment teams to operations teams
- Documentation and training materials are localized
- Community governance structures are activated
- Seed’s role transitions from deployer to ecosystem steward

---

## 13. Summary

The Seed deployment strategy is designed to work where traditional financial and technical infrastructure cannot. By emphasizing offline-first operation, local empowerment, and gradual scaling, Seed enables resilient financial systems to emerge organically within communities — without requiring banks, smartphones, or permanent connectivity.
