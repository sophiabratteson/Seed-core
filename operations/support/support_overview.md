# Support Overview

This document defines the end-to-end support strategy for Seed devices and the Seed network. Because Seed operates in low-connectivity, offline-first, and resource-constrained environments, the support model is designed to be resilient, decentralized, and usable even when traditional customer support infrastructure is unavailable.

The goal of Seed support is to:
- Maintain user trust
- Minimize device downtime
- Resolve issues without requiring constant internet access
- Scale globally without centralized call centers
- Protect vulnerable users and sensitive financial data

---

## 1. Support Philosophy

Seed’s support model follows five core principles:

- Offline-first: Support workflows must function without internet access.
- Device-centric: Most diagnostics and recovery happen directly on the device.
- Progressive escalation: Problems are handled locally before escalating.
- Human-aware: Support must work for low-literacy and non-technical users.
- Safety-first: User funds, identity, and privacy are prioritized above all else.

## 2. Support Tiers

Seed uses a multi-tier support system designed to operate even in disconnected environments.

### Tier 0: On-Device Self-Recovery
Handled entirely by the Seed device:
- Automated diagnostics
- Guided troubleshooting via on-device prompts
- Visual indicators and icons for common issues
- Offline help menus
- Safe-mode boot for recovery

Examples:
- Battery health warnings
- Radio connectivity tests
- Storage integrity checks
- Fingerprint sensor re-enrollment

### Tier 1: Local Community Support
Handled by trusted local actors:
- Community ambassadors
- NGO partners
- Local cooperatives
- Trained merchants or facilitators

Capabilities:
- Device inspection
- Identity recovery assistance
- Ledger sync verification
- Replacement device issuance (if needed)

No access to private keys or funds is granted at this level.

### Tier 2: Regional Technical Support
Handled by Seed-authorized technicians:
- Firmware re-flashing
- Secure element validation
- Hardware diagnostics
- Forensic review of device failures

May require intermittent internet access, but is not always dependent on it.

### Tier 3: Core Team / Engineering Support
Handled by Seed’s internal engineering and security teams:
- Protocol-level issues
- Security incidents
- Network-wide anomalies
- Critical vulnerability response

This tier is rarely invoked and operates under strict audit controls.

## 3. Supported Issue Categories

Seed support covers the following categories:

- Power and charging issues
- Radio connectivity and mesh sync failures
- Ledger inconsistencies
- Group savings disputes
- Trust score anomalies
- Authentication and fingerprint issues
- Lost or stolen device recovery
- Firmware update failures
- Physical device damage

---

## 4. Offline Support Tools

Seed devices include built-in tools to enable offline support:

- Diagnostic mode with pass/fail indicators
- Error codes with icon-based explanations
- Local event logs (non-sensitive)
- Secure export of anonymized diagnostics
- Emergency recovery sequences

These tools allow issues to be identified without transmitting sensitive data.

---

## 5. User Interaction Model

Support interactions are designed for accessibility:

- Icon-based menus
- Voice prompts in local languages
- Step-by-step guided flows
- Minimal text dependency
- No requirement for external devices

This ensures usability across literacy levels and cultural contexts.

---

## 6. Escalation and Resolution Flow

1. Issue detected by device or user
2. Device attempts automatic recovery
3. User guided through on-device troubleshooting
4. If unresolved, escalate to local support
5. If needed, escalate to regional technical support
6. Core team intervention only for systemic issues

At every stage, user funds remain protected.

---

## 7. Device Replacement Policy (High Level)

If a device must be replaced:
- Ledger is securely recovered or reconstructed
- Identity is re-established using trusted recovery methods
- Trust score continuity rules are applied
- Old device is cryptographically revoked

Replacement never results in loss of funds due to device failure.

---

## 8. Security and Privacy Constraints

Support operations must:
- Never access private keys
- Never view transaction contents
- Never impersonate users
- Never override cryptographic safeguards

All support actions are auditable and constrained by policy.

---

## 9. Metrics and Continuous Improvement

Seed tracks support effectiveness using:
- Mean time to resolution
- Device uptime
- Frequency of escalations
- Recovery success rate
- User trust retention indicators

These metrics inform firmware updates and training programs.

---

## 10. Summary

Seed’s support system is designed to function where traditional fintech support fails. By embedding recovery, diagnostics, and guided assistance directly into the device and empowering local communities, Seed ensures reliability, safety, and trust — even in the most disconnected environments.
