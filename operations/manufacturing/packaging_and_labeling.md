# Packaging and Labeling

This document defines how Seed devices are packaged, labeled, and prepared for distribution. The goal is to ensure durability, regulatory compliance, clarity for end users, and trust for partners and investors, while keeping costs low and logistics simple for deployment in low-infrastructure environments.

---

## 1. Objectives of Packaging and Labeling

- Protect Seed devices during transport and storage
- Ensure compliance with safety, radio, and battery regulations
- Provide clear instructions for first-time users
- Support traceability, inventory management, and recalls
- Reinforce trust, legitimacy, and brand consistency
- Enable distribution in humanitarian, rural, and low-literacy contexts

Packaging must balance **robustness, cost-efficiency, and accessibility**.

## 2. Packaging Design Principles

### 2.1 Durability
- Packaging must withstand:
  - Heat
  - Humidity
  - Dust
  - Rough handling during transport
- Internal cushioning protects:
  - E-ink display
  - Antenna connectors
  - Power inputs (USB, solar, hand crank)

### 2.2 Simplicity
- Minimal number of components
- No unnecessary plastics
- Easy to open without tools
- Easy to reseal if required

### 2.3 Sustainability
- Prefer recyclable or biodegradable materials
- Avoid mixed-material laminates where possible
- Minimize packaging volume to reduce shipping emissions

---

## 3. Packaging Components

Each Seed unit package includes:

- Seed device
- Power accessories (as applicable):
  - USB charging cable
  - Optional solar panel or hand-crank module
- Quick-start guide (paper)
- Regulatory and safety insert
- Tamper-evident seal or indicator

Optional additions for pilot programs:
- Field deployment checklist
- Group onboarding cards
- Training pictograms

---

## 4. Labeling Requirements

### 4.1 External Box Labeling

External packaging must include:

- Product name: **Seed Device**
- Manufacturer name and contact
- Country of manufacture
- Device model/version
- Radio frequency band (e.g., 868 MHz / 915 MHz)
- Battery type and capacity
- Regulatory symbols (region-dependent)

### 4.2 Device-Level Labeling

Each Seed device must have:

- Unique device ID (human-readable + QR code)
- Serial number
- Manufacturing batch code
- Power ratings
- Compliance markings (laser-etched or durable print)

Labels must remain legible for the lifetime of the device.

---

## 5. Regulatory and Compliance Labeling

Packaging and device labeling must support compliance with:

- Radio regulations (FCC, CE, regional equivalents)
- Battery transport rules (UN 38.3 where applicable)
- Consumer safety labeling
- Accessibility standards where required

Regulatory inserts must include:
- Battery safety warnings
- Radio usage disclosures
- Disposal and recycling guidance

---

## 6. Language and Accessibility Considerations

- Primary text uses simple language
- Visual icons and pictograms prioritized
- Translations provided for pilot regions
- No assumption of literacy or prior technical knowledge

Quick-start guides must rely on:
- Diagrams
- Step-by-step visuals
- Minimal text

---

## 7. Tamper Evidence and Security

Packaging includes at least one tamper-evident feature:

- Seal sticker
- Tear strip
- Serialized seal number

Purpose:
- Detect interception or device substitution
- Maintain trust in distribution chains
- Support fraud prevention during deployment

---

## 8. Traceability and Inventory Control

Each package is linked to internal records via:

- Device ID
- Serial number
- Manufacturing batch
- Deployment destination (if known)

This supports:
- Inventory tracking
- Warranty handling
- Recall procedures
- Impact reporting

---

## 9. Pilot vs Mass Production Packaging

### Pilot Packaging
- Smaller runs
- Flexible labeling
- Region-specific inserts
- Rapid iteration allowed

### Mass Production Packaging
- Standardized packaging
- Fixed labeling templates
- Pre-approved regulatory markings
- Optimized for logistics and cost

---

## 10. Quality Control Checks

Before shipment, packaging is inspected for:

- Correct device inclusion
- Correct labeling and serial match
- Seal integrity
- Insert completeness
- Physical protection adequacy

Packaging failures trigger rework or rejection.

---

## 11. Branding Considerations

Branding must communicate:
- Trust
- Simplicity
- Reliability
- Neutrality (important in humanitarian contexts)

Brand use avoids:
- Overly technical language
- Political or cultural symbolism
- Excessive marketing claims

---

## 12. Future Enhancements

Potential future packaging features:
- NFC tags for inventory scanning
- Reusable packaging for device redeployment
- Modular kits for different use cases
- Packaging optimized for airdrop or remote delivery

---

## 13. Summary

Seed’s packaging and labeling strategy ensures that devices arrive safely, legally, and clearly to users anywhere in the world. Thoughtful packaging supports trust, scalability, and operational excellence without adding unnecessary cost or complexity.

This system enables Seed to operate credibly across humanitarian, rural, and global financial contexts.
