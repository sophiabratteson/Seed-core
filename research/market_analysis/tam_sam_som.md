# TAM / SAM / SOM Analysis for Seed  
## Updated to Exclude Populations Already Served by Competitors

This document presents a rigorous market sizing model for Seed, an offline-first financial access device designed for populations excluded from traditional banking, mobile money ecosystems, and digital payment infrastructure.

Seed’s market opportunity is unique because it serves users who:
- Do **not** have stable internet access  
- Do **not** have access to formal banking  
- Do **not** consistently use mobile money ecosystems (e.g., M-Pesa, bKash)  
- Live in **cash-dominant**, infrastructure-poor environments  
- Are underserved by digital ID + KYC systems  
- Are excluded from competitor ecosystems (crypto, neobanks, mobile wallets, fintech apps)

This analysis excludes markets already “captured” by competitors.

# 1. Definitions

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)
The total number of people globally who *could* use Seed based on:
- No/low internet access  
- No access to formal financial institutions  
- Heavy reliance on cash  
- Lack of affordable mobile data or devices  
- Absence of existing mobile-money dominance  

## Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
The subset of TAM located in:
- Regions where Seed can realistically operate in early deployment  
- Countries with compatible radio spectrum regulations  
- Environments where NGOs, microfinance orgs, or local governments could support adoption  

## Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
The realistic share Seed can capture in:
- Early pilot countries  
- Within the first 3–5 years of launch  
- Given limited resources, distribution channels, and B2B/B2G partnerships

# 2. Key Filters to Remove Competitor-Served Populations

## Competitor Categories That Seed *Excludes* From TAM
- Mobile-money mature markets (M-Pesa, bKash, MTN MoMo, GCash, etc.)
- Populations with:
  - Smartphones
  - Stable mobile data
  - Active SIM networks
  - Access to a bank or neobank
  - Cryptocurrency users or digital-wallet users

## Core Criteria for Seed’s Real Market  
Seed focuses on:
- Low-income rural communities  
- Offline environments  
- Regions with:
  - Electricity scarcity  
  - No reliable cell towers  
  - No stable banking presence  
  - No SIM card registration infrastructure  
  - No digital identity systems

# 3. TAM Calculation (Fully Updated)

## Step 1: Global Unbanked Population  
- 1.4 billion people are unbanked globally (World Bank Global Findex)

## Step 2: Remove mobile-money-dominant regions  
These markets have high penetration and already have semi-functional financial infrastructure.

- East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda): ~170M  
- South Asia mobile-money hubs (Bangladesh, Pakistan mobile wallets): ~140M  
- Philippines, Indonesia mobile money: ~80M  

**Combined removed: ~390M**

**Remaining unbanked without digital alternatives: 1.4B – 390M = 1.01B**

## Step 3: Remove populations with smartphones but no banking  
Smartphone penetration in developing regions averages ~45%.  
Among unbanked populations, ~30% still own Android smartphones.

Estimate removed:  
- 1.01B × 0.30 ≈ 303M

**Remaining: 1.01B – 303M = ~707M**

## Step 4: Remove populations with intermittent 2G/3G access  
Even weak internet access enables lightweight financial apps.

Estimate removed:  
- ~150M

**Adjusted TAM: ~557M**

---

# 🌍 **Final TAM = ~550–600 million people**  
### These are people with:
- No internet  
- No banking  
- No mobile-money ecosystem  
- No reliable electricity  
- No smartphones  
- No SIM/digital-ID support  
- Entirely financially excluded  

This is Seed’s true total market.

# 4. SAM Calculation (Realistic Near-Term Reach)

SAM focuses on **deployable regions** for Seed’s first phase:

## Countries with:
- Sufficient NGO presence to support rollout  
- Clear need for offline financial tools  
- Legal support for unlicensed low-power LoRa radios  
- Large unbanked populations WITHOUT mobile-money saturation  

### Candidate Regions (Estimated underserved populations):
- Rural India (the offline subset): 120M  
- Nigeria rural zones: 45M  
- Ethiopia: 35M  
- DR Congo: 30M  
- Mozambique: 15M  
- Haiti + Caribbean: 6M  

**Total SAM ≈ 250M**

# 5. SOM Calculation (Seed’s Practical Market in 3–5 Years)

Based on:
- Manufacturing capacity  
- NGO partnerships  
- Government licensing  
- Distribution speed  
- Training + onboarding limits  
- Cash-in/cash-out infrastructure constraints  

## Conservative assumption:
Seed can capture **1–3%** of SAM within 5 years.

- 1% of 250M = 2.5M users  
- 3% of 250M = 7.5M users  

**Final SOM: 2.5–7.5 million users**

---

# 6. Revenue Potential

## If Seed device cost = $12 manufacturing  
And sale price (to NGOs, governments) = $18–$25  

## SOM Revenue (device only):
- 2.5M units × $20 ≈ **$50M**
- 7.5M units × $20 ≈ **$150M**

## Add recurring revenue:
- Micro-transaction rails  
- Credit/trust-score-based financing  
- Group savings facilitation  
- Infrastructure licensing  

Potential recurring revenue:  
**$2–$6 per user annually**  
→ **$5M–$45M/year** across SOM

# 7. Why TAM/SAM/SOM Are Especially Strong for Seed

## Seed is the **only** system that works when:
- There is no internet  
- There is no electricity  
- There is no phone  
- There is no SIM card  
- There is no bank  

No competitive fintech product addresses all five.

# 8. Summary Table

| Category | Population Included | Population Excluded | Result |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| TAM | All unbanked without smartphones, mobile money, or internet | Regions with digital competitors | ~550–600M |
| SAM | Deployable subset in high-need countries | Nations with regulation or infrastructure risks | ~250M |
| SOM | Realistic adoption in 3–5 years | Limitations of manufacturing & partnerships | 2.5–7.5M |

---

# 9. Final Notes

- These numbers are **conservative** and designed for investor credibility.  
- TAM excludes populations with ANY meaningful competitor presence.  
- SAM and SOM reflect real logistical constraints.  
- As Seed evolves (e.g., with a smartphone companion app), TAM can increase by **hundreds of millions**.

Seed represents one of the **largest untapped fintech markets left in the world**, with a need so fundamental that no existing system can address it.
