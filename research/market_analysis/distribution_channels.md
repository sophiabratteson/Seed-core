# Distribution Channels

This document outlines how Seed reaches users, scales adoption, and distributes both hardware and software services in low-connectivity and emerging markets. Because Seed operates outside traditional internet and banking infrastructure, distribution relies on trust-based, community-driven, and institution-partnered channels rather than app stores or centralized platforms.

---

## 1. Distribution Philosophy

Seed’s distribution strategy is built on four principles:

- Go where existing trust already exists
- Minimize reliance on centralized digital infrastructure
- Leverage local economic networks
- Enable organic, peer-driven adoption

Rather than pushing Seed through top-down marketing alone, distribution is designed to grow through community utility and local ownership.

## 2. Primary Distribution Channels

### 2.1 Community-Based Distribution

Community distribution is Seed’s core channel.

Examples:
- Village cooperatives
- Savings groups and rotating credit associations
- Local market associations
- Community leaders or elders
- Grassroots NGOs

Mechanism:
- A small number of Seed devices are introduced to a trusted group
- Group savings and peer-to-peer payments create immediate value
- Devices spread organically as trust and usefulness grow

Advantages:
- High trust
- Low acquisition cost
- Strong retention
- Culturally aligned adoption

---

### 2.2 NGO and Humanitarian Partnerships

Non-governmental organizations are a key early channel.

Target partners:
- Financial inclusion NGOs
- Refugee aid organizations
- Disaster relief groups
- Development agencies
- Women’s economic empowerment programs

Use cases:
- Emergency cash distribution
- Aid transparency
- Group savings programs
- Micro-entrepreneur support

Distribution model:
- NGOs bulk-purchase Seed devices
- Devices are deployed during programs or crises
- Seed becomes embedded in ongoing operations

---

### 2.3 Local Entrepreneurs and Agents

Seed enables a local agent model similar to mobile money agents.

Agent roles:
- Cash-in / cash-out facilitation
- Device onboarding
- Training and support
- Trust score sponsorship

Incentives:
- Small transaction fees
- Group facilitation rewards
- Increased local economic activity

This creates:
- Local jobs
- Decentralized onboarding
- Reduced need for centralized infrastructure

---

### 2.4 Institutional Pilots

Early pilots with institutions provide credibility and validation.

Targets:
- Universities conducting field research
- Development banks
- Governments running pilot inclusion programs
- Foundations funding economic resilience projects

Purpose:
- Validate impact
- Collect data
- Secure follow-on funding
- Establish policy legitimacy

---

## 3. Hardware Distribution Strategy

### 3.1 Direct Distribution

- Seed hardware sold directly to NGOs, institutions, and partners
- Bulk pricing for deployments
- Serialized devices with secure provisioning

### 3.2 Local Assembly and Manufacturing (Long-Term)

- Regional assembly to reduce costs
- Simplified repair and maintenance
- Compliance with local regulations
- Faster scaling

---

## 4. Software and Network Distribution

Seed does not rely on app stores or internet connectivity.

Distribution methods:
- Device-to-device mesh propagation
- Offline firmware updates via trusted nodes
- Local hubs that sync with the broader network when connectivity exists

This allows:
- Network growth without centralized servers
- Resilience in disconnected environments
- Reduced dependency on global infrastructure

---

## 5. Onboarding and Adoption Funnel

1. Initial trusted group receives Seed devices
2. Group savings or payments create immediate value
3. New users request access through trusted members
4. Trust scores and group participation govern growth
5. Network expands organically across communities

Seed’s distribution is intentionally slow at first and accelerates as trust compounds.

---

## 6. Geographic Expansion Strategy

Phase-based expansion:
- Phase 1: High-need, low-connectivity regions
- Phase 2: Adjacent communities via mesh spread
- Phase 3: Regional hubs and cross-border usage
- Phase 4: Global interoperability with internet-connected systems

Each phase builds on existing usage rather than replacing it.

---

## 7. Barriers and Mitigation

### Potential Barriers
- Hardware cost
- Training requirements
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Initial trust hurdles

### Mitigation Strategies
- Subsidized pilot deployments
- Local-language interfaces
- NGO-backed credibility
- Community ownership models

---

## 8. Competitive Advantage in Distribution

Seed’s distribution advantage lies in:
- Offline-first design
- No dependency on smartphones
- Community-native adoption
- Trust-based scaling
- Hardware-software co-design

Most competitors rely on centralized digital platforms. Seed grows through human networks.

---

## 9. Metrics for Distribution Success

Key indicators:
- Devices per community
- Active group savings pools
- Peer-to-peer transaction density
- Trust score growth
- Organic device adoption rate

These metrics reflect real economic integration, not just installs.

---

## 10. Summary

Seed’s distribution strategy prioritizes trust, resilience, and community ownership over speed and scale alone. By embedding directly into local economic systems and leveraging existing social structures, Seed achieves adoption where traditional fintech models cannot operate.

Distribution is not a marketing function for Seed — it is a core part of the system design.
