# Pilot Results Summary

This document captures findings from early pilot studies and exploratory deployments conducted to evaluate the Seed concept, usability, trust dynamics, and feasibility in low-connectivity or resource-constrained environments. These results inform design decisions, risk mitigation, and investor readiness.

## 1. Purpose of Pilot Studies

The pilot phase is designed to:

- Validate that users understand and trust Seed as a financial tool.
- Observe real-world usage patterns without internet or smartphones.
- Identify usability barriers related to literacy, numeracy, and trust.
- Test early assumptions about group savings, trust scores, and offline syncing.
- Collect qualitative and quantitative evidence to guide MVP refinement.

## 2. Pilot Scope Overview

### Pilot Characteristics
- Duration: Short-term (1–4 weeks per pilot)
- Scale: Small groups (5–30 participants)
- Environment Types:
  - Rural communities with limited internet access
  - Informal vendor markets
  - Community savings groups
  - Disaster-preparedness or emergency-simulation contexts

### Pilot Limitations
- Non-production hardware or simulations
- Manual facilitation by researchers
- Limited geographic diversity
- No real currency custody by Seed (ledger-only representation)

---

## 3. Participant Profile Summary

### User Types Included
- Small-scale vendors
- Daily wage workers
- Community group leaders
- NGO field coordinators
- Technically inexperienced users

### Key Observations
- High comfort with physical buttons and simple screens
- Strong preference for clear balances and transaction confirmations
- Initial skepticism followed by trust when group visibility was present
- Low tolerance for complex menus or hidden states

---

## 4. Key Findings

### 4.1 Usability Insights
- Users preferred:
  - Step-by-step transaction flows
  - Audible or visual confirmation after actions
  - Clear error messages rather than silent failures
- Confusion arose when:
  - Transactions appeared delayed due to offline sync
  - Trust scores changed without explanation

### 4.2 Trust and Social Dynamics
- Group savings features increased trust significantly
- Users were more willing to transact when:
  - Other trusted members were visible
  - Transaction history was transparent
- Trust scores were intuitively understood when framed as “reliability” rather than “credit”

### 4.3 Offline Behavior
- Users accepted delayed updates when:
  - The system clearly indicated “pending” status
  - They understood that syncing occurs when devices meet
- Users preferred local confirmation over remote verification

---

## 5. Quantitative Indicators (Early Signals)

While pilots were not statistically powered, early indicators included:

- High task completion rates for basic send/receive actions
- Low error rates after first assisted use
- Increased frequency of transactions over time within groups
- Reduction in disputes when shared ledgers were visible

---

## 6. Group Savings Pilot Outcomes

### Observations
- Group savings cycles were easy to understand
- Rotating payout mechanisms aligned with existing informal practices
- Peer accountability reduced missed contributions

### Challenges
- Need for clearer scheduling indicators
- Need for visual distinction between personal and group funds

---

## 7. Failure Cases and Friction Points

Identified challenges included:

- Misinterpretation of pending transactions as failures
- Concerns over device loss before understanding recovery mechanisms
- Desire for human mediation during disputes
- Need for clearer onboarding and training flows

These issues directly informed subsequent design iterations.

---

## 8. Design Changes Informed by Pilot Results

As a result of pilot findings, the following changes were prioritized:

- Explicit transaction state indicators (pending / confirmed)
- Simplified navigation structure
- Expanded explanations for trust score changes
- Clearer group savings summaries
- Stronger emphasis on physical security and recovery protocols

---

## 9. Investor-Relevant Takeaways

- Seed aligns with existing informal financial behaviors rather than replacing them.
- Users quickly adapt when the system mirrors familiar trust structures.
- Offline-first design is not a barrier when communicated clearly.
- Social transparency is a stronger trust driver than technical explanations.
- Early pilots validate the core thesis: decentralized finance can work without internet or smartphones.

---

## 10. Next Steps

Planned follow-ups include:

- Larger pilots with independent facilitators
- Longer-duration group savings cycles
- Field testing with prototype hardware
- Measurement of retention and trust score stability
- Expanded geographic and cultural diversity

---

## 11. Summary

Pilot results provide strong qualitative validation of Seed’s approach. While early and limited in scale, findings consistently support the feasibility of an offline-first, socially grounded financial system. These results justify continued investment in hardware prototyping, software refinement, and expanded field trials.
