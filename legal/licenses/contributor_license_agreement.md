# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) documents the rights granted by contributors to the **Seed Project** (“Seed”). This Agreement ensures that all contributions to Seed’s open documentation and prototype code can be safely used, improved, distributed, and commercialized, while protecting both the contributor and the project maintainers.

By submitting a contribution, you agree to the terms below.

---

## 1. Definitions

**“Contribution”**  
Any code, documentation, design files, specifications, or other materials submitted to the Seed Project, whether via GitHub pull request, email, file upload, or any other method.

**“You” / “Contributor”**  
The individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution.

**“Seed Maintainers”**  
The project owners and designated reviewers who manage the Seed repositories.

---

## 2. Copyright License

You grant Seed a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license** to:

- reproduce your Contribution  
- prepare derivative works  
- publicly display and perform the Contribution  
- distribute the Contribution  
- sublicense the Contribution for project-related purposes  

You retain full copyright ownership of your work.

This simply lets Seed legally include your Contribution in the project without future permission requirements.

---

## 3. Patent License

If your Contribution includes patentable ideas, you grant Seed a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license** to:

- make  
- use  
- sell  
- offer for sale  
- import  

any implementation of your Contribution.

This protects Seed from future patent disputes.

---

## 4. Moral Rights

To the extent allowed by law, you agree not to assert moral rights such as requiring attribution or preventing modification.  
However — the Seed team will still strive to credit contributors publicly whenever reasonable.

---

## 5. Contributor Representations

When submitting a Contribution, you confirm that:

1. **You own the Contribution**, or you have the legal right to submit it.  
2. **Your Contribution does not violate any third-party rights**, including copyright, trade secret, or patents.  
3. **You are not knowingly submitting malicious code.**  
4. **Your Contribution is original or properly licensed.**  
5. Contributions created as part of employment are approved by your employer (if applicable).

---

## 6. No Warranty

Seed accepts Contributions **“as-is”**, without any warranty that they work, are secure, or meet any fitness for use.

This protects you from liability.

---

## 7. Licensing of the Seed Project

Seed may be licensed under:

- an open-source license  
- a dual commercial/open license  
- a proprietary license for hardware components  
- special terms for humanitarian or nonprofit partners  

This Agreement allows Seed to evolve its licensing strategy without needing repeated legal approval from contributors.

---

## 8. Right to Re-License

Seed maintainers may:

- relicense the project  
- merge Contributions into different codebases  
- use Contributions in commercial versions of Seed  

This ensures Seed can scale globally and support enterprise, government, and humanitarian deployments.

---

## 9. Revocation

This Agreement is **irrevocable** once a Contribution is accepted.  
This prevents legal or operational issues if a contributor later changes their mind.

---

## 10. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Seed Project is headquartered, unless otherwise required by global contributors’ local laws.

---

## 11. Signature

Contributors agree to this Agreement through one of the following:

- Submitting a pull request  
- Checking a CLA box on GitHub  
- Sending the Contribution through email with the text:  
  “I agree to the Seed Contributor License Agreement.”  
- Uploading or attaching work to any Seed-managed repository  

No physical signature is required.

## 12. Summary (Non-Legal)

- Seed gets permission to use it forever.
