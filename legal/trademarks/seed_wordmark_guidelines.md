# Seed Wordmark Guidelines

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines how the Seed wordmark must be used across product materials, packaging, software interfaces, investor decks, websites, and partner collateral. These guidelines protect the integrity, distinctiveness, and legal enforceability of the Seed brand as it expands globally.

## 2. Official Wordmark
Seed’s official wordmark is the plain-text representation of the brand name:

Seed

This wordmark may only be displayed using approved typography, spacing rules, and capitalization.

## 3. Capitalization Rules
- The wordmark must always appear as: Seed
- Never use all caps (SEED) unless typographically required in contexts such as hardware engraving.
- Never use all lowercase (seed) in branded materials.
- Never pluralize or modify the mark (e.g., "Seeds", "Seeded", "Seed Wallets").
- The wordmark should not be used as a verb (e.g., “Seed me money”).

## 4. Typography Requirements
### Approved Typeface
- Primary font: Inter (Regular or Medium)
- Alternate system-safe font: Arial or Helvetica

### Styling Restrictions
Do not apply:
- Italics
- Underlines
- Drop shadows
- Gradients
- Decorative scripts
- Compressed or expanded letter spacing beyond ±2%

The wordmark must remain clean, neutral, and highly legible in low-connectivity or low-resolution environments.

## 5. Color Guidelines
### Approved Color Palette
- Primary: Black (#000000)
- Secondary: Seed Green (#1F9F5F)
- Monochrome inversion: White (#FFFFFF) on dark backgrounds

### Restrictions
- Do not apply neon colors or gradients.
- Do not place the wordmark over complex images that harm readability.
- Maintain minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for accessibility.

## 6. Clear Space Requirements
Maintain clear space around the wordmark equal to the height of the “S” in “Seed.”

No text, icons, UI elements, or borders may infringe on this protected zone.

## 7. Minimum Size
- Digital: Minimum width 60px
- Print: Minimum width 18mm

The wordmark must always remain recognizable and crisp even on e-ink displays used by Seed devices.

## 8. Prohibited Uses
The wordmark may not be:
- Altered, stretched, or warped
- Combined with any other symbol or partner brand unless explicitly approved
- Placed in a sentence formatted as a logo
- Animated in a way that distorts legibility
- Used in parody, satire, or political messaging without legal approval
- Used on counterfeit hardware, unofficial firmware, incompatible apps, or third-party mesh networks

Trademark violations weaken brand distinctiveness and can jeopardize legal protection.

## 9. Licensing and Authorized Use
The Seed wordmark is protected under trademark law. It may only be used by:
- Seed, Inc. and its subsidiaries
- Official manufacturing partners
- Academic collaborators with written permission
- NGOs participating in approved pilot programs
- Developers using the mark in accordance with Seed’s open-hardware and open-protocol trademark rules

Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.

## 10. Co-Branding Rules
When displayed alongside a partner brand:
- The Seed wordmark must appear equal to or larger than the partner’s logo unless contractually specified.
- Maintain the clear space guidelines on all sides.
- The Seed mark may not imply endorsement of partner financial services unless formally approved.

## 11. Application for Devices and Hardware
For hardware engravings and printed enclosures:
- Use monochrome engraving only.
- Maintain proportional scale.
- Wordmark must be positioned in a protected area away from ports, vents, or screws.

For e-ink screens:
- Use high-contrast black-on-white or white-on-black display.
- Maintain padding to avoid ghosting.

## 12. Application for Software and Interfaces
In Seed UI screens:
- Use the standard wordmark at onboarding, home screen, and device boot.
- Do not recreate “customized wordmarks.”
- Do not animate the mark on low-power screens.

## 13. Trademark Notices
Whenever legally required:
Seed® for a registered mark  
Seed™ for an unregistered but claimed mark

Placement:
- Bottom-right corner of the mark
- Or in footnotes of printed/digital materials

## 14. Enforcement
Seed will monitor for:
- Confusingly similar marks
- Unauthorized derivative names (e.g., Sead, Ceed)
- Competitors using “Seed” for financial or hardware products
- Misuse in counterfeit devices or cloned firmware

Enforcement tools include:
- Takedown notices
- Cease and desist letters
- Suspension of API or hardware partnership access
- Trademark litigation when necessary
