# Seed Logo Guidelines

This document defines the usage rules, restrictions, and brand-safety protections for the Seed visual logo. These guidelines ensure that the Seed identity remains consistent, legible, and trusted across all global contexts, especially in low-connectivity and humanitarian environments.

---

## 1. Purpose of These Guidelines

- Protect the integrity of the Seed brand.
- Ensure consistent use of the Seed logo across products, marketing, partnerships, and research.
- Prevent misuse, distortion, or misleading associations.
- Support future trademark registration and international brand protection.
- Enable partners and implementers to correctly display the logo in both high-tech and resource-limited settings.

---

## 2. The Seed Logo

The Seed logo consists of two elements:

- The Seed symbol: a simplified geometric seed sprout representing growth, empowerment, and economic inclusion.
- The wordmark: the name "SEED" in a clean, accessible, sans-serif font designed to remain legible on e-ink screens and low-resolution devices.

Both components together form the primary logo. They may not be altered, rearranged, or separated except where explicitly allowed.

---

## 3. Approved Logo Variants

Seed maintains a minimal, globally consistent set of logo variants:

### Primary Logo
- Symbol + wordmark stacked or horizontal.
- Preferred for all digital and print use.

### Monochrome Logo
- Black on white or white on black.
- Mandatory for use on e-ink devices, low-power displays, and regulatory labels.

### Single-Symbol Mark
- Symbol only, without wordmark.
- For device boot screens, embossed enclosures, buttons, or areas with limited space.

---

## 4. Safe Usage Rules

### Minimum Clear Space
Maintain a clear margin around the logo equal to the height of the “S” in the wordmark.  
No text, graphics, or interface elements may enter this space.

### Minimum Size
Logos must remain fully legible on all screen types:

- Digital: minimum width 40 px.
- Printed: minimum width 10 mm.
- E-ink displays: minimum width 30 px recommended for clarity.

### Background Control
Use only on backgrounds that preserve contrast and readability:

- Prefer white, black, or Seed’s neutral palette.
- Avoid busy, patterned, or low-contrast imagery.
- Do not apply transparency or blending effects.

---

## 5. Forbidden Modifications

The Seed logo may never be:

- Stretched, compressed, rotated, skewed, or warped.
- Displayed in unapproved colors.
- Outlined, shadowed, or placed in a glowing effect.
- Displayed with altered symbol geometry.
- Combined with another logo to form a hybrid mark.
- Embedded within another symbol or shape.
- Animated without explicit approval.

Any alteration that reduces clarity or changes meaning is prohibited.

---

## 6. Localization Rules

- The wordmark "SEED" must remain in English to protect trademark consistency.
- Local-language descriptors (e.g., "community finance device") may appear below the logo but must follow spacing and font rules.
- The symbol may not be adapted or localized.

This ensures that Seed is recognized globally across borders and humanitarian regions.

---

## 7. Co-Branding Rules

For partnerships with NGOs, governments, or academic institutions:

- Seed’s logo must appear first and left-aligned in equal-weight layouts.
- All partner marks must be visually balanced and placed within the approved co-branding layout.
- Seed branding cannot imply endorsement of political, religious, or commercial entities without explicit approval.

---

## 8. Usage in Hardware and Firmware

### Device Enclosure
- Engraved or printed monochrome symbol allowed.
- Must follow minimum size and clear-space rules.

### Boot Screens / UI
- E-ink displays must use the monochrome version.
- UI placements must use the horizontal primary logo or symbol-only version.

### Packaging
- Primary logo required on box front.
- Symbol-only permitted on small accessories or inserts.

---

## 9. Usage in Software and Websites

- Must appear in header or footer of official Seed applications.
- White-space must be maintained around the mark to maximize visibility.
- On dark-mode interfaces, use the white monochrome version.

---

## 10. Legal Restrictions

To protect the trademark under international law:

- The logo may not be used to imply financial custody, banking partnerships, or regulatory endorsements without approval.
- Unauthorized resale, modification, or reproduction is forbidden.
- Only officially licensed manufacturers may apply the logo to hardware.
- Logo usage must comply with each country's trademark and consumer-protection laws.

Violations may jeopardize Seed’s global trademark rights.

- Seed symbol: design mark (pending registration).
- Global protection strategy includes:
  - USPTO registration.
  - Madrid Protocol for international coverage.
  - Defensive trademark filings for variations and similar spellings.
