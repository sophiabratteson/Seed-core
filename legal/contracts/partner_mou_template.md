# Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
# Between Seed and Partner Organization

## 1. Purpose of This Agreement

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes a collaborative relationship between Seed and the Partner Organization for the purpose of deploying, testing, and improving Seed’s offline-first financial technology system. This agreement outlines shared goals, responsibilities, operating principles, and expectations for both parties.

## 2. Shared Objectives

- Expand access to inclusive financial tools in low-connectivity or underbanked communities.
- Pilot Seed devices and gather real-world user feedback.
- Ensure responsible, ethical, and culturally appropriate deployment.
- Support community members in understanding and adopting Seed technology.
- Measure economic, social, and operational impact of the Seed ecosystem.

## 3. Scope of Collaboration

### Seed Responsibilities
- Provide prototype Seed devices as specified in a separate appendix.
- Supply firmware updates, software tools, and training materials.
- Offer onboarding sessions for local staff or field workers.
- Maintain data privacy, device security, and user protection standards.
- Support troubleshooting within reasonable operational limits.

### Partner Organization Responsibilities
- Identify suitable participants for field testing and deployment.
- Provide local coordination, oversight, and communication.
- Offer community insights to improve Seed adoption and usability.
- Report device failures, user issues, or environmental challenges.
- Ensure responsible handling and storage of Seed devices.

## 4. Deployment Framework

- Devices may be used for savings groups, microcommerce, offline transfers, educational pilots, or other approved financial inclusion efforts.
- Deployment may occur in phases, including training, small-group pilots, and broader rollouts.
- Both parties will determine data collection methods for non-personal pilot metrics.
- Deployment must comply with local laws, cultural norms, and safety requirements.

## 5. Data and Privacy Principles

- Seed operates on a local, offline-first model that minimizes central data exposure.
- No personally identifiable information will be collected without explicit user consent.
- Ledger data stored on devices belongs to the users, not the organizations.
- Pilot metrics shared between parties will remain anonymized and aggregated.
- Both parties agree to uphold ethical and responsible use of financial technology.

## 6. Financial Terms

- Unless otherwise agreed, Seed provides prototype hardware at no cost for pilot testing.
- The Partner Organization covers operational costs such as transportation, training space, and local staffing.
- Future financial agreements may include cost-sharing, device purchase, or co-funding of expansions.
- No party is obligated to enter into future commercial arrangements.

## 7. Intellectual Property

- All Seed hardware designs, firmware, software, mesh protocols, and trust-score logic remain the sole intellectual property of Seed.
- Partner Organization gains no ownership rights to Seed’s technology.
- Partner feedback may be used to improve Seed but does not transfer intellectual property.

## 8. Reporting and Communication

- Regular check-ins will occur weekly or monthly depending on the pilot phase.
- The Partner Organization will provide feedback on:
  - device performance
  - user behavior and adoption patterns
  - challenges or risks encountered
  - community suggestions
- Seed will provide updates on improvements, new features, and bug fixes.

## 9. Duration and Termination

- This MOU is effective upon signature by both parties.
- Initial term lasts 12 months unless extended in writing.
- Either party may terminate the MOU with 30 days written notice.
- Devices must be returned or responsibly decommissioned if required.

## 10. Non-Binding Nature
