This agreement applies to:
- University researchers
- Graduate students
- Independent researchers
- NGO-affiliated researchers
- Technical advisors contributing research artifacts

## Scope of Collaboration

Research collaborations may include, but are not limited to:
- Mesh networking performance analysis
- Offline ledger consistency modeling
- Trust and reputation systems research
- Power efficiency and energy harvesting studies
- Security and threat modeling
- Human-centered design and usability studies
- Field pilots and observational studies
- Simulation development and evaluation

Each collaboration must be documented with a written scope describing:
- Research objectives
- Duration
- Deliverables
- Access level to Seed systems or documentation
- Publication intent (if any)

## Intellectual Property Ownership

### Background IP
- Each party retains ownership of intellectual property created prior to the collaboration.
- Background IP must be disclosed before collaboration begins.

### Foreground IP
- All inventions, designs, algorithms, data structures, protocols, documentation, or research outputs created during the collaboration that relate to Seed’s core technology are considered **Foreground IP**.
- Foreground IP is owned by Seed unless otherwise agreed in writing.
- Researchers grant Seed a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, commercialize, and sublicense Foreground IP.

### Joint IP

## Data Ownership and Usage

- All data collected using Seed devices, simulations, or systems is owned by Seed.
- Researchers may access anonymized or aggregated datasets only as authorized.
- Raw user-identifiable data may not be retained, copied, or redistributed.
- Data usage must comply with local privacy laws and Seed’s privacy policies.

## Confidentiality

Researchers agree to keep confidential:
- Technical designs
- Protocol specifications
- Security models
- Financial mechanisms
- Unreleased product plans
- User data or metadata
- Internal documentation

Confidential information may not be disclosed without prior written consent from Seed.

Confidentiality obligations survive the termination of collaboration.

## Publication and Disclosure

- Researchers may publish results only after Seed reviews the material.
- Seed reserves the right to delay publication for up to 90 days to:
  - File patent applications
  - Remove sensitive information
  - Protect user privacy
- Publications must not reveal proprietary protocols, cryptographic mechanisms, or exploitable vulnerabilities.
- Seed must be credited as a collaborating entity where appropriate.

---

## Ethical Research Standards

All research must adhere to:
- Ethical data collection practices
- Informed consent where applicable
- Respect for vulnerable populations
- Non-exploitative study design
- Cultural and regional sensitivity

Human-subject research must comply with applicable institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee standards.

---

## Access and Security Controls

- Researchers receive only the minimum access necessary.
- Access credentials are non-transferable.
- Devices, firmware, or datasets provided must be returned or destroyed upon completion.
- Security incidents must be reported immediately.

---

## Compensation and Expenses

- Collaboration may be unpaid, stipend-based, grant-funded, or contract-based.
- Compensation terms must be documented separately.
- Seed is not responsible for unauthorized expenses.

---

## Term and Termination

- Either party may terminate collaboration with written notice.
- Upon termination:
  - Access must be revoked
  - Confidential materials must be returned or destroyed
  - IP rights remain in effect

---

## Liability and Indemnification

- Research is conducted at the researcher’s own risk.
- Seed is not liable for indirect or consequential damages.
- Researchers agree to indemnify Seed against claims arising from misuse of data or systems.

---

## Governing Law

This agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Seed is incorporated, unless otherwise specified in a written addendum.

---

## Amendment Process

- This agreement may be updated by Seed.
- Continued collaboration constitutes acceptance of updated terms.
- Material changes will be communicated in advance.

---

## Summary

This agreement enables Seed to collaborate with researchers while protecting:
- Intellectual property
- User privacy
- Security integrity
- Long-term commercial viability

It balances openness with responsibility and ensures that research advances Seed’s mission without compromising its foundation.
