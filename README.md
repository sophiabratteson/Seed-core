# Seed

Seed is an offline-first financial device designed for communities with limited access to internet, banking infrastructure, and stable electrical power. Seed enables:

- Secure local storage of money balances
- P2P offline transfers through LoRa mesh networking
- Group savings, rotating credit, and trust scoring
- Solar + hand-crank based energy independence
- Ledger synchronization without the internet
- Simple e-ink UI and voice-enabled local AI coach

Seed’s mission is to unlock global economic potential by giving everyone — regardless of geography, infrastructure, or access — the ability to store, send, grow, and manage financial resources.

## Vision

Billions remain disconnected from global finance not because of a lack of intelligence, ideas, or ambition — but because of infrastructure barriers. Seed closes that gap.
