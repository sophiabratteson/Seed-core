# Traction & Milestones

This document outlines Seed’s traction to date and the forward-looking milestones that define progress toward product readiness, adoption, and investment inflection points. Because Seed operates in an underserved and infrastructure-constrained market, early traction focuses on technical validation, research depth, and system readiness rather than traditional revenue metrics.

## 1. Philosophy of Traction for Seed

Seed measures traction differently than consumer fintech startups operating in high-connectivity markets.

Key principles:
- Infrastructure-first validation matters more than early revenue
- Technical credibility and system completeness reduce execution risk
- Early proof focuses on feasibility, not scale
- Milestones are designed to de-risk future capital deployment

Seed’s milestones are structured to demonstrate:
- Technical feasibility
- Market necessity
- Deployment realism
- Responsible governance
