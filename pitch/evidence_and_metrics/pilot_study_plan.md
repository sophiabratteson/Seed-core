# Pilot Study Plan

This document outlines Seed’s pilot study strategy. The pilot is designed to validate technical feasibility, user behavior, trust mechanisms, and real-world value of an offline-first financial system operating without internet, smartphones, or centralized banks. The pilot study provides early traction evidence for investors, partners, and regulators.

---

## 1. Objectives of the Pilot Study

The pilot study aims to:

- Demonstrate that Seed devices can operate reliably without internet access.
- Validate peer-to-peer transaction syncing over a mesh network.
- Observe real user behavior in cash-based, low-connectivity environments.
- Test trust score dynamics and group savings mechanisms.
- Identify usability challenges, failure modes, and adoption barriers.
- Generate quantitative and qualitative data to support investor claims.

---

## 2. Pilot Scope

### Geographic Scope
- One to two low-connectivity communities.
- Target environments:
  - Rural villages
  - Informal markets
  - Refugee or disaster-response contexts
- Initial pilots conducted in partnership with NGOs or local organizations.

### Duration
- Pilot length: 6–8 weeks
- Phases:
  - Week 1: onboarding and training
  - Weeks 2–6: active usage
  - Weeks 7–8: analysis and feedback

---

## 3. Participant Selection

### User Types
- Individual users (vendors, workers, families)
- Small merchant operators
- Group savings participants

### Participant Count
- 20–50 Seed devices
- 50–150 total users interacting indirectly

### Selection Criteria
- Regular use of cash
- Limited or unreliable internet access
- Willingness to participate in interviews and surveys
- Community trust or leadership roles preferred

---

## 4. Pilot Setup

### Device Configuration
- Seed devices preloaded with:
  - Unique device identities
  - Initial balances (test currency)
  - Trust score baseline
- Devices configured for local mesh operation only.

### Training
- In-person onboarding session:
  - How to send and receive money
  - How group savings works
  - How trust scores evolve
- Printed or audio instructions provided for accessibility.

---

## 5. Key Pilot Features Tested

- Peer-to-peer payments
- Offline transaction syncing
- Ledger conflict resolution
- Trust score updates
- Group savings rotation
- Device loss recovery simulation
- Battery longevity and power resilience

---

## 6. Data Collected

### Quantitative Metrics
- Number of transactions per device
- Sync success rates
- Ledger convergence time
- Trust score changes over time
- Group savings completion rates
- Battery usage and recharge frequency

### Qualitative Metrics
- User confidence and trust
- Ease of use feedback
- Perceived safety
- Behavioral changes around saving and spending
- Social dynamics within group savings

---

## 7. Success Criteria

The pilot is considered successful if:

- >90% of transactions sync correctly across devices.
- No unresolved ledger conflicts remain.
- Users successfully complete group savings cycles.
- Trust scores correlate with repayment and participation behavior.
- Users report increased financial confidence or resilience.
- Devices operate continuously without critical failure.

---

## 8. Risk Mitigation During Pilot

- Manual ledger recovery tools available.
- Emergency device wipe enabled.
- Clear opt-out procedures for participants.
- Local facilitator present for technical support.
- Backup paper records used only as safety fallback.

---

## 9. Ethical and Privacy Considerations

- No real currency required during pilot (test credits).
- No personally identifiable information collected.
- Anonymous device IDs only.
- Clear informed consent from participants.
- Pilot complies with local regulations and ethical standards.

---

## 10. Outputs and Deliverables

At the conclusion of the pilot, Seed will produce:

- Pilot performance report
- User feedback summary
- Case studies and testimonials
- Metrics dashboards
- Lessons learned and product roadmap updates
- Investor-ready validation slides

---

## 11. How This Supports Investment

The pilot study provides concrete evidence that:

- Seed works technically in real-world conditions.
- Users understand and adopt the system.
- Offline finance can function without centralized infrastructure.
- Trust and savings can emerge organically without banks.

This data directly supports Seed’s credibility for seed-stage and early-stage investment.

---

## 12. Next Steps After Pilot

- Expand pilot to additional regions.
- Integrate findings into MVP refinement.
- Prepare regulatory discussions.
- Launch fundraising or partnership campaigns.
- Transition from pilot to early deployment.

---

## Summary

The pilot study is Seed’s bridge between concept and reality. It proves that decentralized, offline financial systems can operate at the edge of connectivity — empowering communities, reducing risk, and creating the foundation for a new global financial layer.
