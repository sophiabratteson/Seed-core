# Key Metrics

This document defines the core metrics used to evaluate Seed’s progress, impact, technical viability, and investment readiness. These metrics are designed to be meaningful at the earliest stages of deployment while scaling cleanly toward institutional and global benchmarks.

## 1. Purpose of Key Metrics

Seed’s metrics serve four goals:

- Demonstrate real-world usage and demand
- Validate technical performance in low-connectivity environments
- Measure financial and social impact
- Provide investors with clear signals of scalability and traction

All metrics are designed to be:
- Measurable offline
- Aggregatable when connectivity exists
- Resistant to manipulation
- Comparable across regions

---

## 2. Adoption & Usage Metrics

### 2.1 Active Devices
- Definition: Number of Seed devices that have processed at least one transaction in the last 30 days
- Importance: Indicates real-world usage, not just distribution
- Early benchmark: 100–500 active devices
- Growth signal: Month-over-month increase ≥ 20%

### 2.2 Active Users per Device
- Definition: Average number of unique users interacting with a single Seed device
- Includes: device owner + shared group access
- Early benchmark: 2–5 users/device
- Indicates: communal utility and shared financial infrastructure

### 2.3 Transaction Frequency
- Definition: Average number of transactions per device per week
- Includes: payments, group savings contributions, trust updates
- Early benchmark: 10–30 transactions/week/device
- Shows: stickiness and daily relevance

---

## 3. Financial Flow Metrics

### 3.1 Transaction Volume (Local Currency)
- Definition: Total value of transactions processed by Seed devices
- Measured locally, optionally aggregated later
- Early benchmark: $5,000–$50,000 equivalent processed
- Investor relevance: demonstrates economic throughput

### 3.2 Group Savings Pool Size
- Definition: Total value held in active group savings mechanisms
- Indicates: trust, collective behavior, and long-term engagement
- Early benchmark: $500–$5,000 equivalent per pilot region

### 3.3 Average Transaction Size
- Definition: Mean value per transaction
- Used to understand user behavior and risk profile
- Expected early range: $0.50–$5.00 equivalent
- Supports: micro-finance positioning

---

## 4. Network & Sync Metrics

### 4.1 Offline Duration Tolerance
- Definition: Maximum time devices operate without syncing while remaining consistent
- Early target: ≥ 30 days offline
- Validates: offline-first architecture

### 4.2 Sync Success Rate
- Definition: Percentage of sync attempts that result in successful ledger reconciliation
- Target: ≥ 99%
- Indicates: reliability of mesh protocol and conflict resolution

### 4.3 Conflict Resolution Rate
- Definition: Percentage of detected conflicts resolved automatically without user intervention
- Target: ≥ 95%
- Demonstrates: robustness of deterministic merge logic

---

## 5. Trust & Security Metrics

### 5.1 Trust Score Distribution
- Definition: Distribution of trust scores across users
- Used to detect anomalies, fraud clusters, or onboarding friction
- Healthy signal: normal distribution with gradual upward movement

### 5.2 Fraud / Abuse Incidents
- Definition: Confirmed cases of malicious behavior or attempted manipulation
- Target: near zero in pilot phase
- More important than count: speed of detection and containment

### 5.3 Device Loss Recovery Success
- Definition: Percentage of lost or stolen devices successfully neutralized via wipe/recovery protocols
- Target: ≥ 95%
- Demonstrates: security maturity

---

## 6. Technical Performance Metrics

### 6.1 Power Consumption
- Definition: Average energy usage per day under normal use
- Target: multi-week operation on a single charge
- Critical for off-grid viability

### 6.2 Hardware Failure Rate
- Definition: Percentage of devices experiencing hardware faults
- Target: < 2% in pilot phase
- Signals manufacturing readiness

### 6.3 Message Delivery Reliability
- Definition: Percentage of mesh messages successfully delivered within expected hops
- Target: ≥ 98%
- Validates radio + routing design

---

## 7. Impact Metrics (Investor-Facing)

### 7.1 Unbanked Users Served
- Definition: Number of users without prior access to formal financial tools
- Core impact KPI
- Early benchmark: 70–90% of users unbanked

### 7.2 Emergency Resilience
- Definition: Number of transactions processed during outages or disasters
- Demonstrates Seed’s resilience value
- Strong narrative metric for mission-driven investors

### 7.3 Economic Participation Lift
- Definition: Increase in frequency or volume of economic activity after Seed adoption
- Measured via before/after comparisons
- Long-term impact indicator

---

## 8. Investor Readiness Metrics

### 8.1 Cost per Device (COGS)
- Tracks feasibility of scaling
- Target: steady downward trend with volume

### 8.2 Deployment Cost per User
- Includes hardware amortization and logistics
- Used to model expansion economics

### 8.3 Pilot-to-Expansion Conversion
- Definition: Percentage of pilot deployments that lead to expanded rollouts
- Key signal for funders and partners

---

## 9. Reporting Strategy

- Metrics collected locally on device
- Aggregated opportunistically when connectivity exists
- Privacy-preserving summaries only
- No centralized real-time dependency

---

## 10. Summary

Seed’s key metrics are designed to prove three things simultaneously:

1. People use it
2. It works where nothing else does
3. It can scale responsibly

Together, these metrics provide a clear, credible, and investor-ready picture of Seed’s technical strength, economic relevance, and global potential.
