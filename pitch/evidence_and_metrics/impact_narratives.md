# Impact Narratives

This document outlines the real-world impact stories that Seed is designed to enable. These narratives translate Seed’s technical and economic capabilities into human outcomes that investors, partners, and stakeholders can immediately understand.

## Purpose of Impact Narratives

Impact narratives serve four goals:

- Demonstrate tangible human value beyond abstract metrics
- Connect Seed’s technology to lived experiences
- Support investor diligence on social and economic impact
- Provide material for pitch decks, websites, and grant applications

Seed’s impact is measured not only in adoption or revenue, but in resilience, opportunity, and financial agency.
