# Elevator Pitch — Seed

## 30-Second Version

Seed is an offline financial system designed for communities without reliable internet, electricity, or access to banks. It’s a secure, handheld device that lets people save, send, borrow, and manage money using a peer-to-peer mesh network—no phones, no servers, no connectivity required. Seed turns local trust and human networks into a resilient financial infrastructure, unlocking economic participation for over a billion people who are currently excluded.

## 60-Second Version

Today, over a billion people cannot safely save money, access credit, or participate in the global economy because they lack internet access, formal IDs, or nearby banks. Seed solves this by creating a self-contained financial system that works entirely offline.

Seed is a low-power hardware device with secure identity, an encrypted local ledger, and a long-range mesh radio. Devices communicate directly with one another to send transactions, manage group savings, and build trust scores—without relying on phones, servers, or continuous connectivity.

Seed is designed for extreme environments: rural villages, refugee camps, disaster zones, and low-infrastructure regions. By combining hardware, software, and community-based finance, Seed enables people to store value, grow businesses, and build financial identity where traditional systems cannot reach.

## 90-Second Version

The global financial system assumes constant internet, stable governments, formal identification, and centralized institutions. For over a billion people, those assumptions don’t hold—and the result is financial exclusion.

Seed is a decentralized, offline-first financial platform delivered through a rugged, low-power device. It allows users to securely store money, send and receive payments, participate in group savings, and build trust-based credit—without phones, banks, or internet access.

Each Seed device acts as a node in a peer-to-peer mesh network. Transactions are recorded locally, encrypted, and synchronized opportunistically when devices come into contact. Deterministic conflict resolution ensures that all devices converge on the same ledger state, even after long periods offline.

Seed integrates biometric identity, secure hardware chips, solar and hand-crank power, and an AI assistant that works entirely on-device. The system is designed to be resilient to theft, power loss, censorship, and network outages.

Our vision is to create a bottom-up financial infrastructure that starts locally but can eventually interoperate globally—bringing financial dignity, resilience, and opportunity to the people most often left behind.
