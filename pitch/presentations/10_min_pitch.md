# Seed – 10-Minute Pitch Script

## Purpose of This Pitch
This 10-minute pitch is designed for:
- Early-stage investors
- Grant committees
- University demo days
- Social-impact accelerators

The goal is to clearly communicate:
- The problem
- The solution
- Why Seed is different
- Why it matters now
- Why *you* are the right founder

---

## 0:00–1:00 — Opening Hook

**Opening statement:**

> “Over one billion people globally cannot safely store money, send payments, or access basic financial tools — not because they lack ability, but because they lack connectivity.”

**Key framing:**
- Financial systems assume internet, electricity, and identity.
- Billions of people live without at least one of those.
- Seed exists to remove those assumptions.

---

## 1:00–2:30 — The Problem

### What’s Broken
- Banking requires:
  - Internet
  - Smartphones
  - Formal IDs
  - Centralized infrastructure
- These fail in:
  - Rural communities
  - Refugee camps
  - Disaster zones
  - Fragile states
  - Off-grid economies

### Why This Matters
- People already trade, save, lend, and build businesses.
- They just do it **unsafely**:
  - Cash theft
  - Informal debt
  - No records
  - No accountability

**Key insight:**
> The problem isn’t trust — it’s infrastructure.

## 2:30–4:00 — The Solution: Seed

### What Seed Is
Seed is a **self-contained financial device** that:
- Works **offline**
- Requires **no phone**
- Requires **no internet**
- Requires **no bank**

### What Seed Does
- Stores value securely
- Sends and receives payments peer-to-peer
- Supports group savings and rotating loans
- Maintains a consistent ledger across devices
- Operates on mesh networking

### Core Design Principles
- Offline-first
- Human-centered
- Deterministic and secure
- Built for extreme environments

---

## 4:00–5:30 — How It Works (Simple)

### Hardware
- E-ink display (low power)
- LoRa mesh radio (long-range, low energy)
- Secure element chip
- Solar + hand-crank power
- Local storage

### Software
- Local ledger engine
- Deterministic conflict resolution
- Offline sync protocol
- Trust score system
- Group savings logic

### Key Point
> Every Seed device is its own bank — but they synchronize when they meet.

---

## 5:30–6:45 — Why This Is Different

### Not a Bank App
- No accounts
- No centralized servers
- No cloud dependency

### Not Crypto
- No speculation
- No internet requirement
- No price volatility

### Not Mobile Money
- No smartphones
- No telecom dependency

**Seed is infrastructure, not an app.**

---

## 6:45–7:45 — Market Opportunity

### Who Seed Is For (Initial Focus)
- Rural entrepreneurs
- Market vendors
- Refugee communities
- Disaster-affected regions
- NGOs and aid organizations

### Market Size
- Over 1B unbanked adults globally
- Hundreds of millions live in low-connectivity environments
- Billions moved in informal economies annually

**Long-term vision:**  
Seed becomes a bridge between offline and online economies.

---

## 7:45–8:45 — Traction & Progress

### What’s Been Built
- Full system architecture
- Offline ledger simulation
- Conflict resolution logic
- Mesh sync protocol
- Hardware prototype planning
- Investor-ready documentation

### What’s Next
- Physical hardware MVP
- Field pilots
- NGO partnerships
- Early distribution trials

---

## 8:45–9:30 — Why Now

- Global connectivity gaps persist
- Climate disasters increasing
- Aid systems need resilient tools
- Governments cannot reach everyone
- Technology finally makes this possible

**Seed exists because now it *can*.**

---

## 9:30–10:00 — Closing Ask

### The Ask
- Capital to build and test hardware prototypes
- Strategic partnerships
- Field deployment support
