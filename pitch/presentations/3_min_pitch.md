# Seed – 3-Minute Pitch Script

## Opening (0:00–0:30)

Today, over **one billion people** cannot safely save, send, or borrow money — not because they lack intelligence or ambition, but because they lack **internet access, reliable banks, and stable infrastructure**.

Seed is building a **fully offline financial system** that works anywhere — no internet, no smartphones, no electricity required.

We’re not trying to improve banking.
We’re building what comes **before** banking.

## The Problem (0:30–1:00)

In many regions:
- Cash is unsafe and easily stolen
- Banks are far away or nonexistent
- Mobile money depends on internet or cellular service
- Identity systems exclude refugees, rural populations, and informal workers

Even when people earn money, they cannot:
- Save securely
- Access credit
- Participate in group savings
- Build trust or reputation

The result is stalled local economies and lost human potential.

## The Solution (1:00–1:45)

Seed is a **handheld, solar-powered financial device** that enables:
- Offline payments
- Secure savings
- Group lending
- Trust-based credit scoring

Seed devices communicate directly with each other using **low-power mesh radio**, not the internet.

Each device:
- Stores its own encrypted ledger
- Synchronizes transactions peer-to-peer
- Uses biometric authentication instead of formal IDs
- Works entirely offline, indefinitely

When devices eventually reconnect — even briefly — the network automatically reconciles.

## Why This Is Different (1:45–2:20)

Seed is **not**:
- A mobile app
- A blockchain requiring internet
- A centralized bank or wallet

Seed is:
- Offline-first by design
- Hardware-based, not phone-dependent
- Community-driven, not institution-controlled
- Deterministic and secure without servers

This allows Seed to function in:
- Rural villages
- Disaster zones
- Refugee camps
- Informal economies

Places where traditional fintech simply cannot operate.

## Market & Impact (2:20–2:40)

Our initial focus is:
- Unbanked and underbanked populations
- Informal workers and micro-entrepreneurs
- NGOs and humanitarian organizations

The long-term opportunity is massive:
- A global, interoperable financial layer
- Bridging offline economies into the broader global system
- Unlocking entrepreneurship where it was previously impossible

---

## Traction & Next Steps (2:40–2:55)

We’ve built:
- A working offline ledger simulation
- A full mesh-sync architecture
- A hardware prototype roadmap
- A complete technical and governance framework

Our next steps:
- Field pilots
- Community testing
- Hardware validation
- Strategic partnerships

---

## Closing (2:55–3:00)

Seed gives people **financial agency without requiring infrastructure**.

If money is power,
Seed puts that power back into the hands of the people who earn it.

Thank you.
