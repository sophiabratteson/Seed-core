# Talking Points – Seed

This document provides structured talking points for presenting Seed in conversations, meetings, demos, and investor discussions. These points are designed to keep messaging consistent while allowing flexibility based on audience and time constraints.

---

## 1. Opening Framing

- Seed exists because access to money should not depend on internet access, electricity, or a functioning bank.
- Over one billion people globally cannot reliably store, send, or save money.
- Seed is a **device-based financial system**, not an app and not a bank.

---

## 2. The Core Problem

- Digital finance assumes:
  - Always-on internet
  - Smartphones
  - Stable governments and banking systems
- In many regions:
  - Cash is unsafe
  - Banks are inaccessible
  - Mobile money requires infrastructure that fails frequently
- The result:
  - People cannot safely save
  - Small businesses cannot grow
  - Communities cannot pool capital

---

## 3. What Seed Is

- Seed is a **standalone financial device**
- It works:
  - Offline
  - Without phones
  - Without centralized servers
- Each Seed device:
  - Stores value
  - Maintains a local ledger
  - Communicates with nearby devices via mesh radio
- The network grows organically as more devices come into proximity

---

## 4. How It Works (High Level)

- Users transact locally using Seed devices
- Transactions are:
  - Signed
  - Stored locally
  - Shared peer-to-peer
- When devices meet:
  - Ledgers synchronize
  - Conflicts resolve deterministically
- No single device controls the system

---

## 5. Why This Is Different

- Not a mobile app
- Not dependent on telecom infrastructure
- Not a centralized digital wallet
- Designed for:
  - Rural areas
  - Disaster zones
  - Refugee settings
  - Informal economies
- Hardware-first approach enables trust where software alone cannot

---

## 6. Trust and Safety

- Every device has a cryptographic identity
- Transactions are signed and validated locally
- Trust scores emerge from real financial behavior
- No centralized surveillance or data harvesting
- Users retain control of their financial history

---

## 7. Group Savings and Community Finance

- Seed supports:
  - Group savings circles
  - Rotating loan systems
  - Community accountability
- These mirror existing cultural practices
- Technology reinforces trust instead of replacing it

---

## 8. Why Now

- Declining cost of low-power hardware
- Maturity of mesh networking
- Growing instability of centralized systems
- Increasing demand for resilient, local-first solutions

---

## 9. Long-Term Vision

- Seed is infrastructure, not a product feature
- Over time:
  - Devices form regional networks
  - Regions interconnect opportunistically
  - A global, offline-capable financial layer emerges
- Seed becomes a bridge between informal and formal economies

---

## 10. Closing Statement

- Seed is not trying to replace banks
- Seed gives people financial agency before banks arrive
- If the internet disappears tomorrow, Seed still works
- This is finance designed for the real world, not ideal conditions
