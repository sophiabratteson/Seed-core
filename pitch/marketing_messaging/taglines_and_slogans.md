## 6. Messaging Guardrails (What to Avoid)

Seed messaging should avoid:
- Overuse of technical terms (blockchain, crypto, distributed ledgers)
- Comparisons to speculative finance
- Language implying volatility or risk
- Phrases that feel extractive or colonial
- Overpromising scale too early

Avoid phrases like:
- “Disrupting banking”
- “Replacing governments”
- “Crypto for the unbanked”

Seed emphasizes **complementing**, not replacing.

## 7. Cultural and Linguistic Considerations

All slogans should:
- Translate cleanly into multiple languages
- Avoid idioms
- Avoid slang
- Be understandable at a 6th-grade reading level
- Sound respectful and empowering

When translated, meaning should remain intact even if wording changes.

---

## 8. Evolution Over Time

Early-stage messaging focuses on:
- Access
- Offline functionality
- Community trust

Later-stage messaging may evolve toward:
- Interoperability
- Global bridges
- Institutional partnerships
- Economic resilience at scale

The primary tagline (“Money that works anywhere”) remains constant.

## 9. Summary

Seed’s taglines are intentionally simple, human, and universal. They communicate reliability, dignity, and access without requiring technical explanation. Strong messaging ensures Seed can be understood by users, investors, NGOs, and governments alike — regardless of connectivity, education, or location.
