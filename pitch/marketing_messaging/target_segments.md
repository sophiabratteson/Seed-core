# Target Segments

This document defines the primary, secondary, and future target user segments for Seed. These segments guide product design, messaging, partnerships, and go-to-market strategy. Seed is intentionally designed for users who are excluded, underserved, or constrained by traditional financial and digital infrastructure.

## 1. Segmenting Philosophy

Seed does not segment users by demographics alone. Instead, it segments by **constraints**:

- Lack of reliable internet access
- Lack of formal banking access
- Lack of formal identity
- Exposure to financial instability or crisis
- Need for local, trust-based financial coordination

Seed prioritizes users whose financial agency is limited by infrastructure, not ability.
