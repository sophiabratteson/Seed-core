# Seed — One-Page Pitch

## What is Seed?

Seed is an offline-first financial device and protocol that enables secure saving, payments, lending, and group finance in regions without reliable internet, electricity, or formal banking systems.

Seed turns local communities into their own financial network — powered by low-energy hardware, mesh networking, and a fully decentralized ledger — without requiring smartphones, internet access, or centralized servers.

---

## The Problem

Over one billion people worldwide lack access to:
- A nearby bank
- Reliable internet connectivity
- Secure digital payment systems
- Safe savings or credit tools

Existing financial technologies assume:
- Continuous internet access
- Smartphones
- Centralized identity systems
- Stable power infrastructure

As a result, billions of people are excluded from economic participation, entrepreneurship, and financial security — despite having real cash, real businesses, and real economic activity.

---

## The Solution

Seed is a **standalone financial device** that:
- Works fully offline
- Communicates peer-to-peer via mesh radio
- Stores value and transaction history locally
- Synchronizes securely whenever devices meet

Each Seed device acts as:
- A personal wallet
- A savings account
- A credit reputation tracker
- A node in a shared community ledger

No internet. No phone. No bank required.

---

## How It Works (High Level)

- Users store value locally on Seed, backed by real-world cash or community trust
- Transactions are signed, recorded, and validated on-device
- Devices exchange encrypted transaction data via mesh networking
- Deterministic conflict resolution ensures all devices converge on the same ledger
- Group savings and lending mechanisms operate entirely offline
- Optional kiosks or bridge nodes can sync to the wider economy when available

---

## Key Features

- Offline digital wallet
- Peer-to-peer payments
- Group savings circles
- Rotational micro-loans
- Trust score (offline credit history)
- Fingerprint-based identity
- Tamper-resistant secure storage
- Solar and hand-crank powered hardware
- E-ink display for ultra-low power use
- Local AI financial guidance (optional)

---

## Why Seed is Different

Seed is **not**:
- A mobile app
- A cryptocurrency
- A centralized bank
- A smartphone dependency

Seed is:
- Hardware-first
- Offline-native
- Community-driven
- Resilient to infrastructure failure
- Designed specifically for low-connectivity environments

---

## Market Opportunity

- 1+ billion unbanked adults globally
- Trillions of dollars in informal economies
- NGOs, governments, and aid organizations seeking resilient financial infrastructure
- Disaster-response and refugee contexts
- Rural and underserved regions worldwide

Seed enables economic participation where traditional fintech cannot operate.

---

## Business Model (Early)

- Sale of Seed devices
- Institutional deployments (NGOs, governments, aid orgs)
- Transaction-adjacent services (optional, future)
- Premium analytics for organizations (opt-in, privacy-preserving)
- Hardware upgrades and replacements

---

## Vision

Seed’s long-term vision is to become the **financial substrate for the offline world** — enabling anyone, anywhere, to safely store value, transact, build trust, and participate in the global economy regardless of infrastructure.

---

## Current Status

- Core architecture defined
- Offline ledger and conflict resolution designed
- Two-device offline prototype validated
- Hardware components selected
- Full technical documentation underway
- MVP development in progress

---

## The Ask

Seed is seeking:
- Early technical advisors
- Pilot partners (NGOs, researchers, field orgs)
- Pre-seed capital to finalize MVP hardware and field testing

Seed is building financial access for the hardest environments on Earth — starting where the internet stops.
