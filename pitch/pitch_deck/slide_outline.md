# Seed Pitch Deck – Slide Outline

This document defines the complete slide-by-slide structure for Seed’s primary investor pitch deck.  
It is designed to support early-stage, pre-seed to seed investors evaluating Seed as a high-impact, technically differentiated, offline-first financial infrastructure platform.

---

## Slide 1: Title

- Seed
- Offline Financial Infrastructure for the World’s Unconnected
- Founder: Sophia Bratteson
- One-line tagline: “Money that works without internet, banks, or power.”

Purpose:
- Establish clarity, ambition, and seriousness immediately.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

- Over 1 billion people lack access to a bank.
- Hundreds of millions live without reliable internet or electricity.
- Cash-based economies are unsafe, unscalable, and invisible to the global economy.
- Existing fintech solutions assume:
  - Smartphones
  - Internet access
  - Formal banking rails
- Result:
  - Entrepreneurship is constrained.
  - Savings are insecure.
  - Communities cannot build financial history or resilience.

Purpose:
- Clearly define the structural gap Seed is addressing.

---

## Slide 3: Why Existing Solutions Fail

- Mobile money requires telecom infrastructure.
- Digital wallets require smartphones and internet.
- Banks require documentation, proximity, and trust in institutions.
- Crypto requires connectivity, power, and technical literacy.
- Aid-based solutions are centralized and fragile.

Key Insight:
- No existing system is built for persistent offline operation.

---

## Slide 4: The Seed Solution

- Seed is a standalone financial device.
- Works:
  - Without internet
  - Without phones
  - Without banks
  - With intermittent or no electricity
- Features:
  - Secure offline ledger
  - Peer-to-peer mesh synchronization
  - Local identity and trust scoring
  - Group savings and lending tools
- Seed turns local economies into self-sustaining financial networks.

Purpose:
- Introduce Seed as a fundamentally new category.

---

## Slide 5: How Seed Works (High-Level)

- Each Seed device:
  - Stores a local ledger
  - Creates signed transactions
  - Syncs opportunistically via mesh radio
- No central server.
- No single point of failure.
- Deterministic conflict resolution ensures all devices converge.

Visual:
- Diagram showing multiple devices syncing offline.

---

## Slide 6: Core Use Cases

- Market vendors storing earnings securely.
- Families saving together via group savings pools.
- Small businesses issuing and repaying local loans.
- Refugee camps managing internal economies.
- Disaster zones restoring financial coordination.

Purpose:
- Make Seed tangible and human.

---

## Slide 7: Trust and Credit Without Banks

- Seed introduces a local trust score:
  - Based on repayment behavior
  - Group participation
  - Transaction consistency
- No centralized credit bureau.
- Trust emerges organically from behavior.

Impact:
- Enables lending where banks cannot operate.

---

## Slide 8: Technology Differentiation

- Offline-first architecture.
- Mesh-based ledger synchronization.
- Lamport clock conflict resolution.
- Secure hardware identity.
- Ultra-low power design (solar + hand crank compatible).

Why it matters:
- Seed works where nothing else does.

---

## Slide 9: Market Opportunity

- Target users:
  - Unbanked populations
  - Informal economies
  - Low-connectivity regions
- Initial focus:
  - Humanitarian organizations
  - NGOs
  - Pilot regions with high cash reliance
- Long-term:
  - A global offline financial layer.

Purpose:
- Show both focus and scale.

---

## Slide 10: Business Model (Early)

- Device sales to NGOs and partners.
- Deployment and support contracts.
- Long-term optional revenue:
  - Network services
  - Analytics (privacy-preserving)
  - Enterprise deployments

Note:
- Initial focus is adoption and impact, not extraction.

---

## Slide 11: Competitive Landscape

- Mobile money: requires connectivity.
- Banks: centralized and inaccessible.
- Crypto: online-first and volatile.
- Seed:
  - Offline-native
  - Decentralized
  - Hardware-rooted

Key takeaway:
- Seed is not competing head-on; it opens a new layer.

---

## Slide 12: Traction & Progress

- Architecture fully specified.
- Working offline ledger simulations.
- Hardware prototype in progress.
- Strong academic and mentor interest.
- Clear roadmap to field pilots.

Purpose:
- Demonstrate momentum.

---

## Slide 13: Roadmap

- Phase 1: Prototype + simulations
- Phase 2: Field pilots with partners
- Phase 3: Scaled deployments
- Phase 4: Global interoperability layer

---

## Slide 14: Team

- Founder-driven, mission-first.
- Strong technical grounding.
- Advisor and mentor network forming.
- Designed to scale responsibly.

---

## Slide 15: Vision

- Seed becomes the default financial layer for places the internet never reached.
