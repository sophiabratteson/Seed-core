# Data Points and Charts

This document defines the quantitative data, metrics, and visual charts used in the Seed pitch deck. Its purpose is to provide investors with clear, credible evidence of market size, problem severity, solution impact, and long-term scalability, while remaining honest about Seed’s current stage.

---

## 1. Purpose of Data in the Pitch

The data in Seed’s pitch deck is designed to:

- Quantify the scale of the problem Seed addresses
- Demonstrate unmet demand not solved by existing systems
- Support Seed’s technical and economic feasibility
- Show potential for global scale and network effects
- Build investor confidence through evidence-based storytelling

Data is used to support the narrative — not overwhelm it.

---

## 2. Core Data Categories

Seed’s pitch uses data across six core categories:

1. Global financial exclusion
2. Connectivity and infrastructure gaps
3. Limitations of existing solutions
4. Market opportunity (TAM / SAM / SOM)
5. Early validation and prototypes
6. Long-term economic impact

Each category maps to one or more slides.

## 3. Key Metrics and Statistics

### Financial Access

- ~1.4 billion adults globally are unbanked
- ~2.6 billion adults are underbanked or financially constrained
- Majority reside in low- and middle-income countries

### Connectivity

- ~37% of the global population lacks reliable internet access
- In many rural regions, connectivity is intermittent or absent
- Power instability compounds financial exclusion

### Cash Dependence

- In many target regions, >70% of transactions are cash-based
- Cash systems lack security, portability, and auditability

### Small Business Impact

- Informal microbusinesses represent a major share of GDP in developing economies
- Lack of financial tools limits growth, credit access, and resilience

## 4. Suggested Charts for the Pitch Deck

### Chart 1: Global Financial Exclusion

- Type: World map heatmap
- Shows concentration of unbanked populations by region
- Highlights Africa, South Asia, Latin America

### Chart 2: Connectivity vs Financial Access

- Type: Scatter plot
- X-axis: Internet access %
- Y-axis: Bank account ownership %
- Shows that financial exclusion persists even where connectivity exists

### Chart 3: Existing Solutions vs Constraints

- Type: Comparison table or bar chart
- Rows: Mobile money, digital banks, crypto wallets
- Columns: Internet required, smartphone required, power required
- Visually shows where Seed is uniquely positioned

### Chart 4: TAM / SAM / SOM Funnel

- Type: Funnel or stacked bar
- TAM: Global financially excluded adults
- SAM: Regions Seed can realistically deploy in early
- SOM: Initial pilot-scale adoption

---

## 5. Market Opportunity Metrics

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

- All adults lacking secure, accessible financial tools
- Includes unbanked + underbanked populations

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

- Regions with:
  - Regulatory feasibility
  - Community-based financial practices
  - High cash usage
  - Low but non-zero device penetration

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

- Initial pilot regions
- NGO partnerships
- Small business clusters
- Community savings groups

---

## 6. Prototype and Early Validation Data

At early stages, Seed uses *qualitative + directional* metrics:

- Working offline prototype (two-device demo)
- Ledger sync without internet
- Deterministic conflict resolution
- Power-efficient design assumptions
- Hardware feasibility using existing components

Charts may include:

- System architecture diagram
- Offline sync flow diagram
- Power budget estimate bar chart

---

## 7. Long-Term Impact Metrics

For later-stage storytelling:

- Increase in financial participation
- Reduction in cash loss or theft
- Growth in small business transaction volume
- Participation in group savings systems
- Resilience during outages or disasters

These metrics are framed as **targets**, not current claims.

---

## 8. Data Integrity and Sourcing

All quantitative claims should be sourced from:

- World Bank (Global Findex)
- IMF financial inclusion reports
- GSMA connectivity reports
- Academic research on informal economies
- NGO and development finance institutions

Sources are cited in appendix or backup slides.

---

## 9. Visual Style Guidelines for Charts

- Simple, high-contrast visuals
- Minimal text on charts
- Use annotations instead of dense legends
- Emphasize trends over precision
- Avoid overclaiming or speculative numbers

Charts should support clarity, not complexity.

---

## 10. Summary

Seed’s data strategy balances ambition with credibility. The pitch deck uses clear, well-sourced metrics to show:

- A massive, underserved global market
- Structural limitations of existing solutions
- A unique offline-first approach
- A realistic path from pilot to scale

The data reinforces Seed as a serious, thoughtful, and long-term infrastructure play.
