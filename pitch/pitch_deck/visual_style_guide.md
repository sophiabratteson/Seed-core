# Visual Style Guide – Seed Pitch Deck

This document defines the visual and stylistic standards for all Seed pitch materials. The goal is to present Seed as credible, global, human-centered, and technically rigorous while remaining emotionally resonant and accessible to non-technical audiences.

## 1. Design Principles

Seed’s visual identity is guided by the following principles:

- **Trust First**: Every visual should signal safety, stability, and legitimacy.
- **Human-Centered**: Focus on people, communities, and real-world use.
- **Low-Tech Reality, High-Tech Intelligence**: Reflect simplicity on the surface with sophistication underneath.
- **Global Neutrality**: Avoid region-specific imagery or cultural bias.
- **Clarity Over Flash**: No unnecessary animation or visual noise.
