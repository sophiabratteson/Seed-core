# Investor FAQ – Seed

This document addresses common investor questions regarding Seed’s vision, technology, market opportunity, risks, and roadmap. It is designed to support early-stage fundraising conversations, due diligence, and pitch follow-ups.

---

## 1. What problem does Seed solve?

Seed addresses the lack of access to secure financial tools for people living without reliable internet, electricity, or formal banking systems. Over one billion people globally cannot safely store money, transfer value, or access credit. Existing solutions assume smartphones, constant connectivity, or centralized institutions. Seed enables secure, offline-first financial participation using dedicated hardware and mesh networking.

---

## 2. How is Seed different from mobile money or crypto?

Seed differs in three fundamental ways:

- Seed does not require smartphones, internet access, or constant electricity.
- Seed operates on dedicated hardware optimized for extreme environments.
- Seed uses a deterministic, offline mesh ledger instead of centralized servers or energy-intensive blockchains.

Unlike crypto, Seed does not rely on proof-of-work, public blockchains, or speculative tokens. Unlike mobile money, Seed does not require telecom infrastructure or bank intermediaries to function locally.

---

## 3. Who is the target user?

Seed’s initial target users include:

- Rural communities without banking access
- Informal vendors and micro-entrepreneurs
- Refugees and displaced populations
- Disaster-affected regions
- NGOs and aid organizations operating in low-connectivity environments

Long-term, Seed can bridge offline economies with global financial systems.

---

## 4. How does Seed make money?

Potential revenue streams include:

- Hardware sales (Seed devices)
- Transaction facilitation fees at kiosks or hubs
- NGO and government deployment contracts
- Value-added services (training, analytics, compliance layers)
- Optional enterprise integrations

Seed is designed to support sustainable unit economics while remaining affordable to end users.

---

## 5. Does Seed require a bank license?

Seed is initially designed as a local value-recording and transfer system, not a traditional bank. Regulatory requirements depend on deployment geography and integration level with fiat systems. Seed’s architecture allows phased compliance, beginning with non-custodial local value tracking and expanding toward regulated partnerships as scale increases.

---

## 6. How does money enter and exit the Seed system?

Seed supports cash-based onramps and offramps through trusted intermediaries such as kiosks, merchants, NGOs, or cooperatives. These entities convert physical cash into ledger credits and vice versa. The core ledger functions independently of the on/off-ramp model, allowing flexibility across regions.

---

## 7. How is security handled without internet?

Security is enforced locally using:

- Hardware-backed device identity
- Cryptographic signing of all transactions
- Secure storage and encryption at rest
- Deterministic conflict resolution rules
- Tamper detection and emergency wipe protocols

Seed does not rely on online verification to remain secure.

---

## 8. What prevents fraud or double-spending?

Seed prevents fraud through:

- Deterministic transaction ordering
- Lamport logical clocks
- Ledger validation rules
- Trust score mechanisms
- Group accountability structures

All devices independently reach the same ledger state, making manipulation detectable and correctable.

---

## 9. How does the trust score work?

The trust score reflects behavioral reliability rather than wealth. It increases with consistent repayment, participation in group savings, and honest behavior, and decreases with defaults or malicious actions. Trust scores enable access to informal credit, group lending, and higher transaction limits without requiring formal credit histories.

---

## 10. Is Seed scalable?

Yes. Seed scales horizontally through mesh expansion rather than centralized infrastructure. Each additional device increases network resilience. Long-range radios, store-and-forward syncing, and lightweight message formats allow Seed to operate across villages, regions, and eventually national networks.

---

## 11. What is Seed’s competitive moat?

Seed’s defensibility comes from:

- Deep integration of hardware, software, and protocol design
- Offline-first architecture optimized for extreme constraints
- Proprietary trust and group savings mechanisms
- Regulatory flexibility via modular compliance
- First-mover advantage in true offline financial infrastructure

---

## 12. What stage is Seed currently in?

Seed is in the architecture and prototype phase, with:

- Fully defined system architecture
- Ledger and mesh protocols specified
- Software simulations and demos in progress
- Hardware prototyping underway
- Market and regulatory research completed

---

## 13. What are the biggest risks?

Key risks include:

- Regulatory complexity across regions
- Hardware manufacturing and supply chain challenges
- User education and adoption
- Trust bootstrapping in new communities

Each risk is actively mitigated through phased rollout, partnerships, and modular system design.

---

## 14. What is the roadmap?

- Phase 1: Prototype validation and pilot deployments
- Phase 2: NGO and cooperative partnerships
- Phase 3: Regional scaling and compliance integration
- Phase 4: Global interoperability and financial network bridging

---

## 15. What is the long-term vision?

Seed aims to become the foundational financial infrastructure for the offline world — enabling anyone, anywhere, to securely store, transfer, and grow value regardless of connectivity, identity, or geography.

---

## 16. What kind of investors are a good fit?

Seed is well-aligned with:

- Impact investors
- Early-stage hardware investors
- Frontier technology funds
- Financial inclusion and development-focused funds
- Patient capital aligned with infrastructure-scale outcomes

---

## 17. Why invest now?

Seed is early enough to shape a new category, yet far enough along to demonstrate feasibility. The problem is massive, underserved, and persistent. Seed offers a rare opportunity to build foundational infrastructure with global impact.

---

## 18. How can investors get involved beyond capital?

Investors can support Seed through:

- Strategic introductions
- Regulatory guidance
- Pilot deployment partnerships
- Manufacturing and supply chain expertise
- Long-term governance participation

---

## 19. What is the ask?

Seed seeks early capital to fund:

- Hardware prototyping and testing
- Field pilots
- Regulatory research
- Team expansion
- Initial manufacturing runs

---

## 20. Final takeaway

Seed is not a financial app. It is a financial infrastructure. By rethinking money from the ground up for offline realities, Seed unlocks economic participation for billions who have been excluded — and creates a new foundation for the global economy.
