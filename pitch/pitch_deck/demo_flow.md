# Demo Flow

This document defines the live demonstration flow used during Seed pitch presentations. The goal of the demo is to clearly, confidently, and convincingly show that Seed enables secure financial transactions and group savings **without internet, smartphones, or centralized banks**. The demo is designed to be understandable to non-technical investors while still demonstrating real technical credibility.

---

## 1. Demo Objectives

The demo must accomplish the following:

- Prove Seed works without internet connectivity
- Demonstrate peer-to-peer value transfer
- Show resilience in offline and low-infrastructure environments
- Highlight user trust, simplicity, and security
- Reinforce Seed’s unique differentiation from mobile banking and crypto
- Support the broader narrative of financial inclusion and resilience

---

## 2. Demo Setup Overview

### Physical Setup
- Two Seed devices (or two laptop-based Seed simulations)
- Devices are fully offline (WiFi and cellular disabled)
- Each device represents a different user
- Optional third device representing a community group or kiosk

### Demo Roles
- Device A: Individual user (e.g., street vendor)
- Device B: Another individual user or customer
- Optional Device C: Group savings pool or trusted node

---

## 3. Demo Narrative Context

The demo is framed with a short story:

“You are in a community where there is no reliable internet, no smartphones, and no nearby bank. People still need to save, lend, and pay each other safely. Seed is designed for exactly this environment.”

This narrative sets expectations and grounds the demo in real-world need.

## 4. Step-by-Step Demo Flow

### Step 1: Device Identity Initialization
- Presenter powers on Device A and Device B
- Each device displays:
  - Device ID
  - Owner name or alias
  - Current balance
  - Trust score
- Emphasize that identities are local, secure, and do not require government IDs

### Step 2: Offline Transaction Creation
- On Device A:
  - User selects “Send Money”
  - Enters amount (e.g., 5 units)
  - Selects recipient (Device B)
- Device A creates a signed transaction locally
- Transaction is added to Device A’s local ledger

### Step 3: Mesh-Based Sync (No Internet)
- Devices are brought within range
- Mesh radio activates automatically
- Device A broadcasts its outbox
- Device B receives and validates the transaction
- Both devices update their ledgers

Key message:
“This transfer happened without internet, without servers, and without phones.”

### Step 4: Ledger Consistency Check
- Show that:
  - Device A balance decreases
  - Device B balance increases
- Both devices display matching transaction history
- Explain deterministic conflict resolution briefly

### Step 5: Group Savings Demonstration (Optional)
- Device C represents a savings group
- Each device contributes a small amount
- Group balance updates across devices
- Show transparency and accountability of group funds

---

## 5. Failure & Resilience Demonstration (Optional)

If time allows:

- Turn one device off mid-demo
- Continue transactions on the other device
- Power device back on
- Show automatic reconciliation and ledger convergence

Key message:
“Seed is built for failure — power loss, disconnection, and chaos.”

---

## 6. Security Callouts During Demo

Throughout the demo, verbally highlight:

- Transactions are cryptographically signed
- No central server exists to hack
- Lost or stolen devices can be wiped
- Trust scores discourage abuse
- Ledger history cannot be silently altered

---

## 7. What the Demo Is NOT

Clarify explicitly:

- This is not crypto speculation
- This is not dependent on smartphones
- This is not a replacement for banks — it’s infrastructure where banks don’t exist
- This is not theoretical — it already works at small scale

---

## 8. Investor Takeaways

After the demo, investors should understand:

- Seed is technically feasible
- Seed solves a real, massive problem
- Seed works where others fail
- Seed scales by community adoption
- Seed creates long-term economic infrastructure

---

## 9. Demo Variants

### Short Demo (2–3 minutes)
- One transaction
- One sync
- One clear takeaway

### Full Demo (7–10 minutes)
- Multiple transactions
- Group savings
- Offline recovery
- Trust score explanation

---

## 10. Demo Transition to Pitch

End the demo with:

“What you just saw working on this table is designed to work across villages, refugee camps, disaster zones, and disconnected communities worldwide.”

Transition directly into:
- Market size
- Adoption strategy
- Path to scale
- Investment ask

---

## 11. Demo Readiness Checklist

Before any pitch:
- Devices fully charged
- Internet disabled
- Demo rehearsed end-to-end
- Backup device available
- Clear narrative memorized

---

## 12. Summary

The Seed demo is not about flashy visuals — it is about **credibility, resilience, and trust**. A successful demo makes Seed feel inevitable, not experimental.

If investors believe the demo, the rest of the pitch becomes easier.
