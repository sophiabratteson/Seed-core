# 1. Title Slide

Seed  
Offline Financial Access for the 1.4 Billion Unbanked  
Powered by mesh networking, secure hardware, and AI guidance.

---

# 2. The Global Problem

## 2.1 The Scale of Financial Exclusion
- Over 1.4 billion people remain unbanked.
- 3+ billion lack reliable internet.
- Billions rely entirely on cash because banks, phones, or digital infrastructure are inaccessible.

## 2.2 Structural Barriers
- No internet access in rural or unstable regions.
- No formal ID system.
- Long distances to the nearest bank.
- High fees for digital banking alternatives.
- Low trust in institutions and lack of financial education.

## 2.3 The Economic Cost
- Trillions in untapped productivity.
- Millions of micro-entrepreneurs unable to scale.
- Families cannot save, borrow, or build credit.
- Aid distribution and community finance remain inefficient.

---

# 3. The Opportunity

A massive emerging global financial market:
- Offline-first financial systems.
- Low-cost hardware deployments.
- Community-driven savings groups.
- Cash-to-digital rails without needing banks, SIM cards, or internet.

Seed becomes the financial operating system where infrastructure does not exist.

# 4. Introducing Seed

Seed is a fully offline, secure, mesh-powered financial device that enables:
- Saving  
- Borrowing  
- Peer-to-peer transfers  
- Group savings  
- Trust-score building  
- AI-based financial coaching  

Seed works without:
- Internet  
- Phone signal  
- Smartphones  
- Electricity grids  

It is powered by solar, hand-crank, e-ink, LoRa mesh networking, and secure hardware.

---

# 5. How Seed Works

## 5.1 Core Technology Pillars
- Offline mesh networking (LoRa-based peer-to-peer communication)
- Local ledger with deterministic conflict resolution
- Secure element chip for identity + signatures
- E-ink UI, ultra-low power
- Solar + hand-crank charging
- Embedded AI model trained on-device
- Group savings and trust-score mechanisms
- Emergency features: fake fingerprint, wipe mode, anonymous sync

## 5.2 What Users Can Do
- Store and track money safely
- Send and receive payments across a mesh network
- Participate in rotating savings groups
- Build a community-verified trust score
- Learn savings and budgeting strategies from the local AI agent

Seed becomes their personal bank — in a box.

---

# 6. Why Now

- Costs of embedded hardware have dropped dramatically.
- LoRa mesh has become mainstream and reliable.
- AI models now run locally on microcontrollers.
- Global development orgs are prioritizing financial resilience.
- People increasingly want financial tools that work offline and independent of major institutions.
