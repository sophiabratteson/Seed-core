# TAM / SAM / SOM Analysis

This document presents Seed's Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM). All estimates are based on realistic global development data, refined to avoid overlap with populations already served by traditional banks, mobile money ecosystems, or existing digital payment infrastructures.

Seed targets populations who:
- Lack reliable internet
- Lack access to formal financial institutions
- Lack safe storage of savings
- Lack affordable credit or group lending infrastructure
- Live in cash-dependent economies
- Operate microbusinesses without digital tools
- Experience high financial insecurity or exclusion

The purpose of this analysis is to frame Seed's strategic entry markets and quantify its long-term potential.

# 1. Total Addressable Market (TAM)

## 1.1 Global Unbanked Population (Adjusted)
Base global unbanked population: ~1.4 billion adults  
Remove individuals with access to mobile money systems (e.g., M-PESA, bKash): approx. 400 million  
Remove individuals with reliable smartphones and data access: approx. 300 million  

Adjusted unbanked population potentially reachable via offline-first devices:
- Approximately 700 million adults

## 1.2 Smallholder Farmers and Microentrepreneurs Without Digital Tools
The global population of small-holder farmers and informal microbusiness owners:
- ~500 million individuals
Remove those already using basic digital financial tools:
- ~150 million

Remaining:
- ~350 million potential users

Note: Many of these overlap with the 700 million unbanked adults, but Seed targets them with tailored use cases (group savings, microloans, informal trade finance).

## 1.3 Areas With Documented Weak Connectivity
Regions with consistent low connectivity or unstable access:
- Rural Sub-Saharan Africa
- Inland South Asia
- Lower-income Southeast Asia
- Latin American interior regions

Population living in low-connectivity regions: ~2.7 billion  
Remove those with stable banking or smartphone-based financial tools: ~1.5 billion  
Remaining underserved low-connectivity population: ~1.2 billion  

Overlap with earlier categories exists; estimated unique incremental population:
- ~300 million

## TAM Summary
After deduplicating overlapping groups, an estimated realistic TAM is:

- **~1.0 – 1.1 billion people** who lack stable financial access and would realistically benefit from a Seed device.

This TAM reflects those without:
- banking infrastructure  
- internet  
- reliable electricity  
- secure storage systems  
- access to credit or group financing tools  

Seed is uniquely positioned because it does not require:
- internet  
- smartphones  
- stable electricity  
- formal ID  
- a centralized bank

# 2. Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

Seed's SAM represents populations that meet the following criteria:
- High need for offline-first financial tools
- Geographic accessibility for early deployment
- Compatibility with low-cost device distribution
- Existing NGO, microfinance, or government partnership capacity

We exclude regions with:
- Mature digital finance ecosystems
- High penetration of mobile money
- Strong internet and smartphone usage

## Candidate High-Priority Regions
- Rural Kenya (excluding M-PESA dominant zones)
- Uganda
- Rwanda
- Zambia
- Ethiopia (rural)
- India (rural interior, especially UP, Bihar, Odisha)
- Bangladesh (low-connectivity pockets)
- Nepal
- Indonesia outer islands
- Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua

Estimated combined addressable population with unmet needs:
- Approximately 220–260 million adults

This number is based on:
- Populations lacking consistent internet
- Populations using predominantly cash
- Populations exposed to theft, inflation, or low credit access
- Populations actively engaging in informal finance (rotating savings groups, village funds, etc.)

## SAM Summary
Seed’s SAM is:

- **~240 million people**

These are individuals in regions where Seed could realistically deploy through NGO networks, microfinance partners, or government collaborations in the near term.

# 3. Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

SOM represents Seed’s realistic penetration within the first 5 years of rollout.

Factors affecting SOM:
- Device production cost  
- Distribution and training partnerships  
- Early adopter communities  
- Regional pilot programs  
- NGO/government adoption  
- Word-of-mouth growth in concentrated rural clusters  
- Manufacturing scale  

## Conservative 5-Year Penetration Estimates

### Phase 1: Pilot Countries (Years 1–2)
Target countries:
- Uganda  
- Rwanda  
- Nepal  
- Honduras  

Population reachable in pilots: ~40 million  
Expected adoption through partner networks: 1–2%  
SOM Phase 1: ~400,000 – 800,000 users  

### Phase 2: Regional Expansion (Years 2–4)
Expansion into:
- India rural districts (selected regions)
- Zambia
- Guatemala
- Indonesia (outer islands)

Reachable population: ~120 million  
Projected adoption: 1.5–3%  
SOM Phase 2: ~1.8 – 3.6 million users  

### Phase 3: Scaled Distribution (Year 4–5)
As hardware costs drop and brand credibility rises:
- NGO adoption grows  
- Governments subsidize device distribution  
- Microfinance institutions adopt Seed as infrastructure  

Projected new users: ~4–6 million  

## SOM Summary (First 5 years)
Combining all phases:

- **Total SOM: ~6 – 10 million active users**

This assumes:
- Low-cost hardware production  
- Scalable distribution logistics  
- Strong partner relationships  
- Successful pilot-to-scale transitions  
- Iterative improvement of the Seed platform

# 4. Strategic Implications

## 4.1 Early Markets Provide Fast Learning
Pilot-phase users will inform:
- Ideal hardware cost  
- UX simplicity  
- Offline-first mesh success  
- Group savings adoption rates  
- Fraud resistance  
- Trust-score usefulness  

## 4.2 Seed Expands Through Social Networks  
Low-income, cash-based communities adopt new financial tools through:
- Village-level demonstrations  
- Cooperative leaders  
- Local shopkeepers  
- NGO program staff  

One Seed user often leads to 3–10 new users.

## 4.3 Long-Term Global Expansion
As manufacturing scales and hardware costs drop:
- SAM expands to additional rural regions  
- Government programs may subsidize distribution  
- Seed becomes a global standard for offline financial enablement

# 5. Final Summary

TAM: **~1.0–1.1 billion people**  
People globally who lack internet, banking, and secure financial tools.

SAM: **~240 million people**  
People in regions where Seed can realistically deploy through partnerships.

SOM (first 5 years): **6–10 million active users**  
Achievable early adoption based on targeted pilots and expansion.

Seed’s addressable market is massive, underserved, structurally excluded, and perfectly aligned with an offline-first mesh financial device. With no reliance on smartphones, internet, or electricity grids, Seed unlocks a completely neglected market segment — one traditional fintech cannot reach.
