# User Interviews Summary

This document summarizes Seed's early-stage user interview research. It provides qualitative insights from target users in low-connectivity regions, small merchants, gig workers, micro-entrepreneurs, community leaders, and potential NGO field partners. The goal is to understand financial pain points, trust dynamics, technology access, and real-world constraints that shape the design of Seed’s offline-first financial ecosystem.

# 1. Purpose of the Interviews

- Understand how people currently store, save, and move money without stable banking access.
- Identify the biggest daily financial blockers for unbanked and underbanked populations.
- Evaluate trust in technology, digital money, and peer networks.
- Explore willingness to adopt an offline-capable financial tool.
- Map workflows for borrowing, lending, purchasing, and group savings.
- Validate assumptions about device accessibility, literacy, and energy availability.
- Gather feedback on Seed’s core value proposition and feature set.

- Conducted remotely with interpreters when required.
- Participants recruited through:
  - NGO partners
  - WhatsApp community groups

  - Students and gig workers in low-income rural areas
- Interview format:
  - Warm-up questions
  - Financial practice exploration
  - Technology access mapping
  - Reaction to Seed concept
  - Scenario testing (lending, saving, emergency situations)

# 3. Participant Profiles

## 3.1 Rural low-connectivity adults
- Limited access to banks or ATMs.
- Rely heavily on cash and informal community lenders.
- Phones often shared among family members.

## 3.2 Small merchants and micro-entrepreneurs
- Street vendors, food stalls, craftspeople, small repair shops.
- Handle 95 percent of revenue in cash.
- Need safer storage and a clearer transaction record.
- Interested in tools that help with budgeting and inventory.

## 3.3 Gig workers and transport workers
- Irregular income
- Need fast small transfers to family or local groups
- Strong need for emergency liquidity

## 3.4 Students and young adults
- Higher tech familiarity
- Strong interest in saving tools and micro-loans
- Often participate in community savings groups

## 3.5 NGO field workers
- Understand community financial behavior
- See high risk of theft, fraud, and record-keeping problems
- Validate feasibility of distributing hardware devices

# 4. Key Themes and Insights

## 4.1 Cash is dominant because alternatives are unreliable
- Digital wallets require internet that rarely works.
- Mobile money fees too high for very low-income users.
- Cash is simple but unsafe, vulnerable to theft or loss.

## 4.2 Community-based finance is extremely strong
- Group savings circles common (rotating savings, fixed weekly contributions).
- Trust is built socially, not institutionally.
- People value transparency, fairness, and shared tracking.

## 4.3 People desire privacy, but transparency inside trusted groups is welcomed
- Individuals want private balances.
- Groups want shared accountability.
- Devices must allow both.

## 4.4 The biggest pain point: lack of emergency liquidity
- Medical emergencies
- Unexpected travel or weather disruptions
- Business inventory replacement
- Users borrow small amounts frequently.

## 4.5 Loss of cash devastates families
- Theft during travel
- Household members misplacing savings
- Natural disasters destroying paper money

Seed’s secure, offline wallet solves a real, consistent pain point.

## 4.6 Technology constraints shape adoption
- Charging devices is difficult.
- Phones are shared; privacy cannot rely on phones.
- Users are comfortable with simple dedicated tools.

This validates Seed’s physical device approach.

# 5. Reactions to Seed Concept

## 5.1 Most compelling features to users
- Offline ability (no need for internet)
- Safe storage protected by fingerprint
- Ability to send money locally
- Transparent group savings
- Trust score for borrowing
- AI-based budgeting guidance (in local languages)

## 5.2 Concerns raised
- Fear that "digital money" is not real
- Fear of losing the device
- Need a clear way to convert real cash into Seed balance
- Community adoption must happen in clusters, not individually

## 5.3 Overall sentiment
- Extremely positive when users understand:
  - The device works without internet
  - The money belongs to them
  - The device replaces risky cash storage
  - Group savings become more fair and transparent

# 6. Behavioral Insights for Product Design

## 6.1 Trust is built through people, not technology
Seed must integrate:
- Peer verification
- Community-based onboarding
- Group accountability mechanisms

## 6.2 Simplicity beats sophistication
- Users prefer 2–3 main screens only.
- Transactions must require minimal input.
- Audio or spoken feedback is valuable for low-literacy users.

## 6.3 Energy resilience is crucial
- Solar + hand-crank validated by nearly all participants.
- Charging a phone is a major barrier; Seed cannot rely on phone pairing.

## 6.4 People want gradual transitions
Seed must allow:
- Hybrid use of cash
- Hybrid use of Seed balance
- Clear visibility into transactions
- Convenient conversion options (vendors acting as cash-in/cash-out agents)

# 7. Hypotheses Validated

- An offline hardware financial device has strong demand.
- People trust small, durable objects more than apps for money storage.
- Group savings automation generates immediate user interest.
- Mesh-based syncing fits real-world connectivity gaps.
- Trust-score mechanisms map closely onto existing cultural norms of reliability.

---

# 8. Feature Refinements Based on Interviews

- Large icons and minimal text for navigation.
- Multi-language voice interface.
- Daily spending summary to improve budgeting.
- Ledger display that users can scroll through visually.
- Automatic sync that requires no settings or configuration.
- Emergency wipe button is highly valued, especially in theft-prone regions.

---

# 9. Recommendations for Next Research Cycle

- Conduct in-person field studies with low-fidelity prototypes.
- Test physical form factors with real users.
- Evaluate trust-score acceptability in various cultures.
- Observe group savings workflows in natural settings.
- Interview small merchants on their preferred cash-in/cash-out models.
- Investigate cross-border remittance use cases.

# 10. Conclusion

User interviews strongly validate the need for Seed: an offline-first, durable, community-centered financial device designed for unbanked and low-connectivity populations. The research demonstrates:

- Clear unmet needs around safety, liquidity, and transparency.
- Strong cultural fit with group-based financial practices.
- Real value in simplifying financial behaviors and reducing risk.
- Widespread enthusiasm for a dedicated, secure device requiring no phone or internet.

This research provides a foundational understanding of user behavior and informs product strategy, MVP scoping, feature prioritization, and deployment planning for Seed.
