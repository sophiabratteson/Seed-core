# Seed AI Model Training Strategy

This document outlines the full training strategy for Seed’s offline-first, on-device AI assistant. The AI system must operate reliably without internet, adapt to user behavior over time, and remain safe, lightweight, and computationally efficient on low-power hardware.

The strategy includes model selection, dataset construction, training workflow, personalization method, privacy protections, update pathways, and long-term evolution of the AI stack.

# 1. Goals of the AI System

- Provide financial guidance tailored to low-connectivity contexts.
- Operate fully offline with minimal RAM and compute requirements.
- Deliver clear, local-language responses.
- Learn progressively from user behavior while maintaining strict privacy.
- Prevent harmful or manipulative outputs.
- Support financial literacy, budgeting, scam avoidance, and trust-score explanations.

# 2. AI Architecture Overview

Seed uses a hybrid AI approach:

## 2.1 Offline Micro-Language Model
- A distilled, extremely small LLM-like model (20M–100M parameters).
- Optimized for short text classification, intent detection, and templated generation.
- Runs entirely on-device using int8 or int4 quantization.

## 2.2 Rule-Based Systems
- Hard-coded financial rules.
- Guardrails to prevent harmful instructions or hallucinations.
- Ensures deterministic behavior for sensitive tasks.

## 2.3 Behavior-Based Personalization Layer
- Learns patterns such as:
  - Savings habits
  - Spending frequency
  - Transaction categories
  - Group savings participation
- Generates nudges and insights using statistical models rather than large AI.

This architecture ensures Seed never requires cloud models or expensive computation.

# 3. Training Data Strategy

## 3.1 Pretraining Datasets
Pretraining uses lightweight but relevant corpora:

- Public-domain financial education texts.
- Poverty-alleviation training manuals.
- Microloan repayment case studies.
- Behavioral economics datasets.
- Contextual advice prompts for underserved regions.
- Multilingual financial terminology glossaries.

All datasets must avoid sensitive personal information.

## 3.2 Fine-Tuning Datasets
Fine-tuning focuses on Seed-specific tasks:

- Classified financial intents (e.g., "send money", "explain savings").
- Common user Q&A adapted to low-connectivity environments.
- Scam detection patterns (phishing attempts, suspicious requests).
- Cultural and regional phrasing based on local partner input.
- Group savings troubleshooting scenarios.

## 3.3 Continual Learning Datasets (On-Device)
No cloud data collection is allowed. Personalization occurs locally:

- Spending trend vectors.
- Savings goal progress.
- Historical categories generated by the ledger.
- Trust-score evolution patterns.

Data never leaves the device.

# 4. Model Training Workflow

## 4.1 Phase 1: Pretraining
- Train a compact language model on curated general datasets.
- Use tokenizers optimized for multilingual capability (English, French, Hindi, Arabic, Swahili, Spanish, etc.).
- Target model size: ≤ 100M parameters for full offline support.

## 4.2 Phase 2: Seed-Specific Fine-Tuning
- Add supervised instructions on Seed tasks.
- Include:
  - Sending/receiving money workflows
  - Group savings logic explanations
  - Scam warnings
  - Budget feedback
- Validate outputs with real partner organizations in emerging markets.

## 4.3 Phase 3: Safety Alignment
- Implement refusal behaviors for:
  - High-risk financial recommendations
  - Medical, legal, political, and harmful instructions
- Add templated safe responses for all ambiguous or risky topics.
- Incorporate multilingual safety filters.

## 4.4 Phase 4: Quantization and Compression
To ensure on-device performance:
- Apply int8 or int4 quantization.
- Use operator-level optimizations for MCUs or low-power chips.
- Test inference speed under battery-saving modes.

## 4.5 Phase 5: Deployment
- Ship the model on secure storage (secure element or encrypted partition).
- Validate performance in offline scenarios.
- Perform adversarial testing for financial-harm scenarios.

# 5. Personalization Logic (Local Learning)

Seed uses local, private, incremental data:

## 5.1 Behavior Tracking
- Spending frequency
- Savings reliability
- Group participation
- Historical repayment patterns
- Trust-score deltas

## 5.2 On-Device Adaptation
Techniques:
- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA-like updates)
- Small preference vectors stored securely
- Statistical trend modeling for nudges

## 5.3 Privacy Guarantees
- No cloud syncing.
- No central training server.
- No user data leaves the device.
- Personalization files are encrypted and tied to fingerprint identity.

# 6. Multilingual Support Strategy

## 6.1 Prebuilt Translation Dictionaries
Stored locally for:
- Common financial terms
- UI strings
- Safety responses

## 6.2 Region-Specific Variants
Different firmware builds for:
- Africa (Swahili, Hausa, Amharic, Arabic, French)
- South Asia (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil)
- South America (Spanish, Portuguese)

## 6.3 On-Device Language Switching
- All logic is stateless and multilingual.
- No internet needed for language packs.

# 7. Safety and Ethical Guardrails

## 7.1 Content Filters
Prevent:
- Financial scams
- Harmful advice
- Abusive or offensive text
- High-risk claims (legal, political, medical)

## 7.2 Financial-Harm Protection
The AI will:
- Warn when a scam pattern is detected.
- Double-confirm risky or large transfers.
- Flag abnormal group savings behavior.
- Never recommend risky financial strategies.

## 7.3 Explainability Requirement
All AI recommendations must:
- Be short
- Be transparent
- Reference simple reasoning
- Never manipulate or shame the user

# 8. Model Update Strategy

## 8.1 Offline Firmware Updates
- Distributed via partner organizations.
- Updates delivered using:
  - USB sideload
  - SD card
  - Over-mesh "slow update" rollout

## 8.2 Version Control
- Each firmware includes:
  - Model version
  - Safety rules version
  - Localization pack version

## 8.3 Backward Compatibility
Old devices must still interpret core instructions even on outdated models.

# 9. Hardware Constraints and Optimization

## 9.1 Target Hardware Profile
- < 120 MHz MCU
- < 512 MB storage
- < 128 MB RAM (preferably far less)
- No GPU
- Ultra-low-power sleep cycles

## 9.2 Optimizations
- Quantized inference kernels
- Token caching
- Sliding window context
- Precomputed response templates
- Batching avoided to reduce memory spikes

# 10. Metrics for Evaluation

# 12. Summary

Seed’s AI system is designed for extreme environments where cloud AI is impossible. The model is small, efficient, multilingual, privacy-preserving, and aligned with financial safety principles. It improves user outcomes without risking harm or requiring connectivity.

This strategy ensures the AI remains trustworthy, lightweight, and globally scalable.
