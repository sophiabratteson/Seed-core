# Team Roles and Responsibilities

This document outlines the key roles required to develop, launch, and scale the Seed platform. Because Seed spans hardware, software, cryptography, mesh networking, field deployment, research, and regulatory considerations, the project requires a multidisciplinary team. The roles below describe each function, its core responsibilities, and the expected deliverables. These roles may initially be filled by a small founding team wearing multiple hats, then later expanded as Seed grows toward pilot deployments and mass adoption.

## Summary

Seed requires a uniquely cross-functional team combining hardware engineering, cryptography, mesh networking, AI, economic research, human-centered design, and field logistics. Many early-stage roles may be held by a single founder or small team, but this map outlines the complete structure Seed will evolve into as it scales toward global deployment.
