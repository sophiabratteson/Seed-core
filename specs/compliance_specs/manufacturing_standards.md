# Manufacturing Standards

This document defines the manufacturing standards Seed must meet to ensure safety, reliability, scalability, and regulatory compliance across all regions of deployment. These standards apply to prototype builds, pilot manufacturing runs, and full-scale production.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The manufacturing standards for Seed are designed to:

- Ensure consistent device quality across all production batches
- Support safe operation in low-resource and high-stress environments
- Enable scalable manufacturing without compromising security or durability
- Align with international electronics, safety, and sustainability standards
- Build investor and regulator confidence in production readiness

These standards apply to:
- Seed hardware devices
- Accessories (chargers, hand-cranks, solar panels)
- Packaging and labeling
- Manufacturing partners and subcontractors

---

## 2. Core Manufacturing Principles

Seed manufacturing follows these core principles:

- **Safety-first design**
- **Offline-first reliability**
- **Minimal failure points**
- **Long service life**
- **Ethical and sustainable sourcing**
- **Global deployability**

All manufacturing decisions must prioritize resilience over cost optimization in early stages.

---

## 3. Reference Standards and Frameworks

Seed manufacturing aligns with the following widely recognized standards where applicable:

- ISO 9001 – Quality Management Systems
- ISO 14001 – Environmental Management Systems
- IPC-A-610 – Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies
- IPC-2221 – PCB Design Standards
- IEC 62368-1 – Safety for electronic equipment
- RoHS – Restriction of Hazardous Substances
- REACH – Chemical safety and traceability
- UN 38.3 – Lithium battery transport safety
- FCC / CE – Radio emissions and device compliance

Seed may exceed these standards where regional conditions require higher resilience.

---

## 4. Manufacturing Partner Requirements

All manufacturing partners must:

- Demonstrate experience producing embedded electronics
- Support low-to-medium volume pilot runs
- Provide documented quality control processes
- Allow design-for-manufacturability (DFM) feedback loops
- Support traceability of components and batches
- Agree to confidentiality and IP protection agreements

Manufacturers must support both prototype iteration and scale-up phases.

---

## 5. Component Sourcing Standards

### 5.1 Approved Component Criteria

Components must meet the following requirements:

- Long-term availability (minimum 5-year lifecycle)
- Operation across wide temperature ranges
- Proven reliability in embedded systems
- Vendor documentation and traceability
- Compliance with safety and environmental regulations

### 5.2 Restricted Components

Seed avoids components that:

- Have known counterfeit risk
- Lack datasheets or vendor support
- Require proprietary tooling
- Depend on unstable supply chains
- Require rare or ethically problematic materials

---

## 6. PCB Manufacturing Standards

Printed circuit boards must adhere to:

- Multi-layer PCB design with proper ground planes
- Controlled impedance for radio traces
- Adequate spacing for high-voltage and battery lines
- ESD protection at all external interfaces
- Clearly labeled test points for diagnostics

PCB vendors must support:
- Prototype runs
- Electrical testing
- Visual inspection
- Gerber and BOM validation

---

## 7. Assembly and Integration Standards

Assembly processes must ensure:

- Proper solder joint integrity
- Mechanical reinforcement for connectors
- Secure mounting of batteries and radio modules
- Tamper-resistant enclosure assembly
- Minimal use of adhesives where replacement may be needed

All assemblies must pass functional testing prior to packaging.

---

## 8. Quality Control and Testing

Each device must undergo:

- Visual inspection
- Power-on self-test
- Radio transmission test
- Secure boot verification
- Storage and memory validation
- Battery charge/discharge test

Sampling-based stress testing is required for each production batch.

---

## 9. Traceability and Documentation

Seed manufacturing requires:

- Unique device identifiers
- Batch-level tracking
- Component traceability logs
- Manufacturing test records
- Firmware version documentation

This enables:
- Recall management
- Security auditing
- Field diagnostics
- Regulatory reporting

---

## 10. Packaging and Labeling Standards

Packaging must:

- Protect against moisture and impact
- Include clear handling instructions
- Display regulatory markings
- Support multilingual labeling where required
- Minimize environmental impact

Labels must include:
- Device ID
- Manufacturing batch
- Power ratings
- Safety warnings

---

## 11. Environmental and Sustainability Considerations

Seed manufacturing prioritizes:

- Reduced plastic usage
- Recyclable packaging
- Energy-efficient manufacturing processes
- Battery recycling compatibility
- Repairability over disposability

Environmental compliance is required for all suppliers.

---

## 12. Scaling and Continuous Improvement

As Seed scales, manufacturing standards will:

- Evolve based on field feedback
- Incorporate automation where appropriate
- Expand regional manufacturing options
- Tighten quality tolerances
- Integrate sustainability metrics

Manufacturing standards are reviewed at every major production milestone.

---

## 13. Investor and Regulatory Readiness

These manufacturing standards demonstrate that Seed:

- Is designed for real-world deployment
- Can scale responsibly and safely
- Meets global compliance expectations
- Minimizes operational and regulatory risk
- Is production-ready beyond the prototype stage

---

## 14. Summary

Seed’s manufacturing standards ensure that every device is safe, secure, durable, and globally deployable. By aligning with established international standards while prioritizing resilience and ethical production, Seed builds a strong foundation for long-term impact and scalable growth.
