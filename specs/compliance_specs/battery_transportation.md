# Battery Transportation Compliance Specification

This document defines the compliance requirements, safety standards, and operational procedures governing the transportation of batteries used in Seed devices. Because Seed is designed for deployment in remote, low-infrastructure, and cross-border environments, battery transportation compliance is critical for safety, legality, scalability, and investor readiness.

This specification focuses primarily on lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄) batteries, which are selected for Seed due to their superior thermal stability, long lifecycle, and reduced fire risk compared to other lithium chemistries.

---

## 1. Objectives

- Ensure all Seed battery shipments comply with international transportation regulations.
- Minimize safety risks during storage, shipping, and handling.
- Enable cross-border logistics without reliance on specialized hazardous-materials infrastructure.
- Support scalable manufacturing, pilot deployments, and global distribution.
- Reduce regulatory friction for NGOs, partners, and distributors.

---

## 2. Battery Chemistry Scope

Seed devices are designed to use:

- **Primary Chemistry:** Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO₄)
- **Nominal Voltage:** ~3.2V per cell
- **Energy Density:** Lower than Li-ion, but significantly safer
- **Thermal Runaway Risk:** Extremely low
- **Cycle Life:** 2,000–5,000+ cycles

LiFePO₄ batteries are favored because they:
- Do not combust easily
- Are more tolerant to heat
- Are less restricted than lithium cobalt-based cells
- Are more acceptable for humanitarian and development deployments

---

## 3. Applicable Regulatory Frameworks

Seed battery transportation must comply with the following standards, depending on shipment mode:

### Air Transport
- **IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR)**
- **UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (UN 38.3)**

### Sea Transport
- **IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code)**

### Ground Transport
- **ADR (Europe)**
- **DOT / PHMSA (United States)**

All Seed batteries must be:
- UN 38.3 tested
- Shipped with appropriate documentation
- Classified correctly based on watt-hour rating

---

## 4. UN 38.3 Testing Requirements

Every battery model used in Seed devices must pass UN 38.3 testing, including:

- Altitude simulation
- Thermal cycling
- Vibration
- Shock
- External short circuit
- Impact/crush
- Overcharge
- Forced discharge

Documentation must be retained and available for:
- Manufacturers
- Logistics partners
- Customs authorities
- Investors and auditors

---

## 5. Watt-Hour Classification

Seed batteries are intentionally designed to fall below key regulatory thresholds:

- **Target Capacity:** <100 Wh per battery
- Enables simplified air transport
- Reduces labeling and handling restrictions
- Allows shipment via standard carriers in many regions

This design decision materially reduces logistics cost and regulatory complexity.

---

## 6. Packaging Standards

All battery shipments must follow these packaging principles:

- Individual battery insulation (terminal protection)
- Non-conductive internal packaging
- Crush-resistant outer cartons
- Clear orientation markings
- Shock-absorbing material for vibration protection

For device-integrated batteries:
- Battery must be securely enclosed
- No exposed terminals
- Device casing must meet drop-resistance standards

---

## 7. Labeling and Documentation

Each shipment must include:

- Lithium battery handling label (as required)
- UN number and proper shipping name
- Battery test summary (UN 38.3)
- Emergency contact information
- Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)

Documentation should be standardized and reusable across shipments.

---

## 8. Shipping Scenarios Covered

This specification applies to:

- Prototype shipments
- Pilot program deployments
- NGO bulk distributions
- Replacement battery logistics
- Cross-border humanitarian aid deliveries
- Returns and recycling programs

Special consideration is given to low-resource environments where customs infrastructure may be limited.

---

## 9. Risk Mitigation Strategies

Seed mitigates battery transportation risk by:

- Selecting LiFePO₄ chemistry
- Limiting battery capacity
- Designing sealed, tamper-resistant enclosures
- Avoiding removable consumer battery access where possible
- Partnering with certified battery suppliers
- Maintaining clear audit trails for compliance

---

## 10. End-of-Life and Reverse Logistics

Battery transportation compliance also applies to:

- Returned devices
- Decommissioned hardware
- Recycling programs

Seed will:
- Partner with certified recycling providers
- Provide return labeling where required
- Avoid informal disposal channels
- Document environmentally responsible handling

---

## 11. Investor and Partner Assurance

This compliance strategy ensures that:

- Seed can scale globally without regulatory bottlenecks
- Distribution partners face minimal legal exposure
- Insurance and underwriting risks are reduced
- Humanitarian and development deployments remain viable
- Battery safety concerns do not impede adoption or funding

---

## 12. Summary

By designing around LiFePO₄ batteries and strict transportation compliance, Seed achieves a rare combination of:

- Safety
- Scalability
- Regulatory simplicity
- Global deployability

Battery transportation is treated not as an afterthought, but as a core system design constraint that enables Seed’s long-term mission.
